We were taken directly to our villa by our butler. He was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. He was there for us any time we needed him. I can say that almost all the staff was just perfect! We loved all the waiters in Athiri! They always treated us very nicely and it made us feel very special. Everyone on the island tried their best to feel us very comfortable. Except for only one girl in the jewelry shop... i think she is a maldivial, but I might be wrong. It was the only negative moment on the island that ruined the whole impression of the resort. As we were planning to buy some gifts for my parents and my husband's nieces, we decided to visit the jewelry shop because we heard there was a special turtle collection. But whenever we come-the shop was always closed. When we finally get the chance to visit it-that girl looked like we interrupted her personal time because she looked kinda irritated. She only cared about her phone which was vibrating all the time and didn't pay much attention to us. Unfortunately there are no price tags on the items, so we had to ask her for assistance. She only gave us approximate price and when we asked for exact price-she started checking her papers and it took ages. Our mood got completely spoilt by that time and we just left. Other than that our stay was very good! The food in the restaurants was very delicious! We enjoyed sting tay feeding-that was one of the most amazing experience in our lives!!!

The food is delicious and, in fact, we had one of the best pastas that we ever had and it was made by a Sri Lankan chef. We went on the snorkeling trip, which was also great.

We arrived and greeted by our butler, Ubad welcoming us with fresh coconut juice and cold towels, just everything we needed after a 45 minute seaplane. Then we went for an island tour where they showed all the facilities, restaurants and everything else we can do in the island, everything is clear and on point. Our butler then escorted us to the room and explained things we will need. I really like how we can use the IPad to control everything; the curtains, the lights, the TV. All the announcements, menus, restaurant timings and directory are all there as well. Which is a plus for me being environmentally conscious of not printing anything extra. The villa is beautiful, the pool is huge, the bathroom has 2 sinks, a big tub, a shower and 2 outdoor showers, what else can you ask for? :) The Garden Villa is the most private villa with complete walls, so if you are into privacy, Garden Villa is the best choice! Special thanks to our butler Ubad who made sure that our stay is amazing. He does the daily restaurant bookings for us, without being asked and you'll be surprised when the time comes, he'll be outside waiting for us to be sent to the venue. He is very attentive to detail, made sure to answer every question we have and he is just literally one WhatsApp message away. I also asked a favor to place a gift for my boyfriend on the bed upon turndown, but when we came it was there with complete set of decoration. I love how they make this simple request of mine into something really special. He also check on us every once in a while to make sure our stay is perfect, thank you so much Ubad!\r\n\r\nYou'll never run out of things to do in the island. All the villas have bikes that you can use around the island, which is really convenient and a fun way to go around. Every day they do the champagne sabering at 18:30 at the whale bar, a perfect place to have your sunset cocktail. The Iridium Spa is insane! I've never seen any treatment room and changing facilities as big and as complete as that. The changing room has sauna, steam room, locker, bathrobe, slippers and all the toiletries you will ever need. We also tried the Blue Hole and it was the most relaxing pool experience we had, a must-try! Thank you Lezil & Faisal for your warm welcome and hospitality, you made our spa experience perfect. We also tried the morning yoga and the anti-gravity yoga, which I think everyone should really experience as it is a unique facility which only few resorts offer. It is our first time doing anti-gravity yoga but Dr. Vishnu made sure we had a great first experience and yes, we'll definitely do it again. P.S. He makes everything looks easy too, in reality it is not.:) But yes, we were able to do it with his guidance, indeed one fulfilling experience! I like how he guide us step by step throughout the session.\r\n\r\nEvery single staff in the island gives you a greeting with their warm smile that makes you feel at home. In the restaurants, people always greet us by name and make sure we get everything we need. Shout out to Naufal and Joyce for the great service and good chat! The food in all the restaurants are really great. The breakfast has a lot of variety, you cannot try everything even if you want to. The chefs and staff are going around to check every once in a while if everything is perfect with the food and your stay. Special thanks to Chef Pradeep, Chandana, Priyantha and Sumit! They all made sure to go beyond what is expected. Oh, thank you Shiyan at the airport too, the very first person we met and made sure we had a smooth check-in!\r\n\r\nThe attention to detail in everything makes all the difference! This is what makes them stand out.\r\n\r\nAbove all, their Director of Rooms, Ahmed and Resort Manager, Harish are always on the check on us, which is really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you so much St. Regis Team! It was a wonderful experience.","text":"From the moment we arrived at the airport, to the lounge, and to the island until the time we departed everything is amazing.

Our room (i.e. Villa) was amazing (sunset overwater villa) - it had a private pool and was pretty close to the reef - you could just swim out the backyard. We are Marriott Ambassador Elites so had breakfast included (amazing breakfast), but other than that there was not much in terms of our status here. Our butler, Haroon, was amazing and worked with us to make our stay as amazing as possible, booking activities, restaurants, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe food was okay. I knew before going it would be expensive, but I had a few dishes that I really wasn't happy with. Honestly, my steak or the burger were the best I had while there. Surprisingly, the Indian dishes were disappointing (butter chicken, chicken tikka, and something with Paneer), and our meal at Orientale was just ok. Cargo was delicious and Alba was really good. Didn't try Decanter.\r\n\r\nMost disappointing was our $1200+ Whale Shark and Manta Ray trip. We paid so much money for it and we were more people than advertised on a boat (not the nice yacht, just a regular fishing boat), going 1.5 hours each way in order to \"look for shadows in the water\". This is not like Cayman sting ray city where there are many in the same area. We kind of drove around in the sun for 1-2 hours looking into the water for the whale shark and didn't find anything. Even more disappointing was that we found out none of the trips that week had seen the whale shark, and some of the staff told us that only around May do the whale sharks usually frequent that area. The advertised \"snacks\" for \"lunch\", were literally fruit kabobs\/skewers and water. If we had known this is how the trip would have been we would have used that $ for other things - spa, other activities, etc.\r\n\r\nThe UV-light night snorkeling was disappointing too. Paid 50$ extra to use a UV light for about 10 seconds. Avoid those two and your trip should be good!","text":"We had an almost perfect stay.

We opted for the larger St. Regis Suite but in hindsight, we really wanted to see the sunset from our room which makes me advise to reserve a sunset overwater villa since #521 does not see much of either sunrise or sunset.

Additionally, the pool is quite cold since the sun never touches it.\r\n\r\nThere were some missteps along the way but we\u2019re quickly rectified by our expert butler Shamiu. He was consistently composed and honestly told us \u201cif you need anything, I\u2019ll make it happen\u201d. And he did. He probably was annoyed that we insisted on always riding our bikes to spa, dinner, diving appointments instead of having him drive us in the golf cart!\r\n\r\n10 days was a perfect amount of time for spa treatments, diving, sunning, snorkeling, kayaking, whale shark trip, private island day, yacht charter and private beach dinners.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend a day \/ sunset on Norma.\r\nHighly recommend day on a remote sandbar.\r\nHighly recommend scuba diving.\r\nDon\u2019t recommend whale shark hunting.

The seaplane experience and arrival to the island being greeted by waving staff seemed like a picture straight out of Fantasy Island. Our butler Katie met us at arrival and was by our side (only when we wanted her to be) for the entire visit. Katie did an amazing job of keeping up with our ever changing schedules and took care of our every need. From the bike rides, snorkeling off of our private pool dock, private sunset champage & caviar trip aboard the Norma and Valentine's Day dinner on a private beach eveything was special and no detail was spared. Abra, where we had our morning breakfast, offered many different options and Athit was a pleasure every morning and always greeted us with a smile as well as supplied us with fantastic service. Our housekeeper Ehabb always had a small note or small gesture waiting for us when we returned from dinner and kept our villa looking fresh everyday. Tuna was our server at our private beach dinner and he offered nothing short of 5 star restaurant service.

This place was excellent. We took the basic Silver Studio. Beautiful view of the turqoise sea. Room was comfortable. Breakfast had a good and tasty European spread but limited Maldivian choices.\r\nWe were in room 138 - and there was a small lagoon outside with a rocky border. Lots of fishes at the border. House reef was not so colourful but still had a lot of sea life.\r\nThe bridge to Crossroads was great as it was lit up at night. This attracted fishes, stingrays, baby sharks which we could see clearly whilst walking. Great for people who do not snorkel or dive.\r\nWe went to eat at Ministry of Crab and it was so delicious (although expensive) that we went there AGAIN for the second night. There is a convenience store at the far end of the marina to buy cheap snacks and necessities. Enjoyed my stay. I had a wonderful stay except A few suggestions:\r\n1. Ensure there is tap outside the entrance to the block to wash our feet from the sand. It was messy to have sand all over\r\n2.

Ashley at the gym also! A big thanks! After when we pay attention to some professionalism skill and attitude it\u2019s sometimes limit. With our butler, I think we don\u2019t have a good explanation sometimes, with bike (where there is a different way to brake), me I know, but not my fianc\u00e9e and other guest who lose the bike in the water for exemple. The presentation is not clear enough. And at the end when she forgot to add the 900$ of deposit we left at the beginning because I ask it she come to us and thanks us to remind a yoga class... not clear.. after she is very kind and smiling but I think is better to know more the hotel. Then, there is two kind of room, and the service is not exactly the same, our house on the beach was amazing clean by the housekeeping but the one on the sea, first big noise from outside, I signal it to the butler, the very kind guys from engineering came, the nous was less but still here, and our butler never came back to know if it was better or not. And the housekeeping was very good on details and arranging the room. But I have to say that I prefer the house on the water experience for the view. I know it\u2019s a little details but as I work 15 years in a palace and gastronomic place for me it\u2019s important. Also, about food, breakfast is amazing, pastry quality is very impressive and meals in general are good but is it not possible to have more fish and sea food on the menu?! I don\u2019t understand. Too much meat in my opinion. And the last things is the taxes!!! I leave in Shanghai and I worked in the luxury hotel but I still not understand this way to not put the final prices for the guest! It not a luxury way at all!.. For all the rest! Amazing place!","text":"Amazing location, beautiful and big lagoon, very nice layout and very kind staff, all, and specially the UMI cafe with Hannah, who is the most professional, and her team.

I found the price is manageable similarly to Singapore\u2019s price. Cafe Umi is the one you probably will have breakfast most of the time. You also have a choice to have breakfast at The Retreat , I would compare the Retreat with Club Lounge of the hotel. Try Maldivian Breakfast !\r\n\r\nFish Market & The Lighthouse are another 2 restaurants available here. They are both my favorite but I will give more scores to Fish Market where they offer you catch of the day. The menu is more to Asian\u2019s favor.

We really enjoy spending time and talking to her, she is such an adorable and positive young lady!\r\n\r\nAt the Retreat Lounge, the waiters and waitresses(esp. Rama) were very friendly, they remembered our names and what we like and didn't like to eat.\r\nI would like to highlight here that Hassan surprised us by serving iced water and Nutella pancake after our swim at the lagoon, just what we needed, we were so touched when we saw him running towards us from the Retreat (a good 10 mins walk) with the drinks and food, something I will never forget.\r\n\r\nJoyce and Jude were excellent managers, they ensured that we get the full experience on the island by offering us to experience both the overwater and Lagoon villas, they also ensured that we get to try out all the bars & restaurants by helping us making reservations in advance, spas and other outdoor activities. I was so impressed with everything that both of them have arranged for us.

Also they offer complimentary drinks and food in evenings at 'bay rouge' , a restaurant by the beach where you can stay and watch the sun going down beautifully. The water villas offer an all time snorkelling in the lagoon below or may be you can just stand and watch the sea flora and fauna in good detail from your deck.

It\u2019s a 40min speed boat away from Male airport which makes it super easy and convenient! The staff welcomed us at the airport and with a swift transfer we were on their boat heading to the island. What we loved was the VARU package, all inclusive which includes dining once each at all the specialty restaurants. When we arrived everything was organised for us, they made a \u201citinerary\u201d for our stay when we were booked in for dinner at the other restaurants and the snorkelling \/ fishing trips etc.\r\n\r\nThe water villa was beautiful, amazing size balcony straight down and out to the beautiful clear water and looking out to the ocean. The bathroom was big, well stocked with all amenities. Our favourite part was the \u201cvino cave\u201d aka wine fridge which was restocked twice daily -SCORE! The NZ Ros\u00e8 was to die for \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. Room cleaned twice per day while you were out at breakfast and dinner.\r\n\r\nThe staff were excellent, accommodating all needs! One night we asked for the Cloudy Bay Sav at dinner and they didn\u2019t have it at that restaurant so the manager went over to one of the others to source it just for us.\r\n\r\nIt was also my partners birthday there and as I mentioned it they organised a beautiful cake for him at the restaurant and put a nice happy birthday message on the bed when they cleaned it while we were out at dinner.\r\n\r\nWe also went scuba diving out there two of the days which was excellent. Blue clear waters, hundreds of fish, sharks and turtles. Not too far away from the island so we could enjoy the rest of the afternoon by the pool, biking around the island or drinking cocktails \ud83c\udf78.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion we have is maybe put some wine\/beers and nibbles on the sunset cruise with some music would have been nice.\r\n\r\nAll in all great stay, thoroughly enjoyed our time at VARU and we were sad to leave paradise.","text":"My Partner and I stayed here for 6nights in December 2019 in a overwater villa and it was faultless!

They involved almost all the guests by encouraging everyone to participate and join the various programs.\r\nKudos to them, for making the entertainment at the hotel both fantastic and memorable!!\r\nThe hotel has cycles on rent, which really adds to the fun.Kids too had cycles so the whole family can join in the activity.\r\nWe stayed in Superior beach bungalow, which was really spacious and well equipped with amenities with an awesome view of the beach right in front of our room. We also stayed at the water villa which was very beautiful and spacious with views which are breathtaking. Since we were with kids, we would prefer the Superior Beach bungalow next time again, as water Villa is a bit too risky with toddlers and young kids if they r left unattended.\r\nWe did kayaking and fishing both of which were complimentary. The hotel has many water sports activities.\r\nThe food also was really good with continental, Asian and Indian cuisines. We loved the Indian food options,delicious food and variety. The chefs too were very friendly and do a great job with the food. Special mention of Chef Premkumar, Chef Chandaran, housekeeping staff Achindar. All of them made our stay comfortable and memorable.\r\nThe staff at the reception, and Photo studio were also very helpful and supportive.\r\nLooking forward to another visit soon!\r\nKeep up the good work!\r\nGod bless!","text":"We had a wonderful holiday at Sun Island in May 2019, it is a beautiful island with scenic views from all sides.

The turquoise lagoon was beautiful, surrounded by nice beaches and many palm trees. We stayed in a beach villa with lush greenery and decent privacy, this is what we always prefer. There are as well some villas which are not hidden within the foliage, perfect for sun-lovers and open-view-seekers. The villas are constructed in traditional Maldivian way with high ceilings, open bathrooms and thatched roofs. All are elegantly decorated and feature warm and bright hues. The quality of linen and towels is high-grade (from the Italian brand Frette), the mattress comfortable and the lightning system is easy to handle. The desalination plant has not been finished yet, but in future they will also produce eco-friendly own bottled water. Bath amenities are provided in refillable bowls.\r\n\r\nBaglioni is not that big so you can easily circle the island on the beach. The pool bar features funny fish ceramics as decoration. At Gusto restaurant lovely artisanal plates especially designed for Baglioni are presented. It is really a lot into details. This Italian outlet focuses on freshly caught local fish and pasta with kind of a modern twist. The airy main restaurant Taste is located on the beach. Here you can also sit with the toes in the sand - a must in the Maldives! Unfortunately, no tropical jam was on offer at breakfast, just some European sorts. I adressed this and hopefully it will be added. Yet, Mas Huni was served on the buffet, that\u2019s also one of my all time favourites. We really enjoyed the Japanese overwater restaurant Umami. The dishes from the Robata grill we can highly recommend. Extra charges for basics like wine\/beer\/pizza are reasonable, that\u2019s nice! Usually it\u2019s overpriced in the luxury league, especially the wines. Dine-Around-option in all three outlets will be introduced as of 1st of December. In the evening, lanterns with candles are placed around the pool which provide a cosy atmosphere. There is also some descreet live music offered in the bar area. Allover you\u2019ll find an absolutely pleasant and serene ambiance. Staff is amiable and attentive.\r\n\r\nThe reef was fabulous in terms of corals, surely one of the best growings we have seen after El Nino. Nice reef formation with many overhangs. Also pretty good for divers as it is spreading out quite far on some parts. Kids will have fun in the \u201ejungle club\u201c located in the middle of the island. Resort activities include tennis, yoga, gym and non-motorised water sports. No jet-skis available, which we really did appreciate. Not to forget the beautifully designed spa with a wide range of treatments.\r\n\r\nBaglioni is a sophisticated island paired with natural beauty and an authentic Maldivian vibe.

The island is quite small but perfect for what we wanted. Kudadoo is managed by extremely experienced staff, and the level of service is fantastic.\r\n\r\nWe chose Kudadoo because of the AAA experience it offers and it certainly went above our expectations in what it included - not only do you have access to a varied menu of food, fine wines and champagne, all spa treatments are included, watersports, private yoga, diving and any bespoke food experiences catered to your requirements. Do not be afraid to speak up because I don't believe there are many requests the Kudadoo staff would not be able to cater to.\r\n\r\nThe rooms are spacious, beautifully designed and offer good privacy ( which isn't very common in the Maldives). The room is well stocked with wine, soft drinks, juices at your request and some home made snacks.\r\n\r\nWe had a brilliant butler Ibrahim who provided a brilliant itinerary for our stay catered to our requirements!\r\n\r\nIf you plan a trip to Kudadoo you are sure to have a wonderful stay","text":"This was our second trip to the Maldives but our first time at the Kudadoo.\r\n\r\nChoosing an island to stay at in the Maldives can be a little daunting as there are so many to choose from, we would highly recommend staying at the Kudadoo to anyone looking for a luxury, bespoke experience.\r\n\r\nWe knew Kudadoo was a relatively new Island so only read...","nickname":"DiondraW "},{"title":"A Perfect experience","date":"20190901","rating":"5","full_text":"I am a guest of your's.

However, for us, Mirihi stands head and shoulders above them all. As a hotel it has a completely different approach where service and food are absolutely top end but are presented in a very simple and relaxed style.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment we disembarked the seaplane and took off our shoes we knew we were experiencing something unique. The beauty of the island is breath-taking and my fears of it being too small were unfounded. We walked, swam and canoed around it most days enjoying the peace and tranquillity. On the island itself we discovered birds, fruit bats and the occasional small lizard (but there were no mosquitoes, wasps or bugs). We also didn\u2019t feel the island was ever crowded despite a staff to guest ratio of around 4:1 whilst we were there. However if the island was beautiful, the house reef was spectacular. We saw all colours and sizes of fish including eagle rays, three species of reef sharks, moray eels, turtles and so many more. We undertook a number of trips - snorkelling further out on the reef with a guide, sunrise fishing (where the wahoo we caught was prepared for lunch) and the day trip searching for a whale shark which was exceptional. Swimming with the majestic manta rays is an experience we recommend to everyone.\r\n\r\nWe opted for the fully inclusive option for our week which included three ridiculously awesome meals a day in the Dhonveli restaurant prepared and presented by a great team led by the ever jovial Fernando who reassured us daily that all his food was negative calories. On two occasions we chose to eat at the Muraka restaurant situated over the water with the reef sharks swimming below. If the food in Dhonveli is five star I don\u2019t know what Muraka is \u2013 the white tomato soup was so fantastic and the steak was exceptional we had the same again on our second visit! We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and on the evening of our anniversary we had a private dining experience on the beach which was something we will never forget. Situated in three areas on the beach we started with canapes and cocktails on a beach bed, moved to the dining table for an unbelievable meal before finishing the evening with coffee and cognac on bean bags. We later returned to our villa to discover that Afeef had transformed our bedroom with flowers, towel designs and a bottle of bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe island is managed with an Exec Team who are always visible and interact with you daily \u2013 Alex and his team provide the most exceptional food, Urs and his team provide the most awesome service and Alexa and her team absolutely ensure that whatever you need is provided. However an Exec Team is only as good as the main team \u2013 there are far too many people to mention but Raoof looked after us daily, Raj ensured our glasses in the bar were never empty and Furqan made us laugh constantly. All the staff, without a single exception, were professional, fun and constantly ensuring everything in paradise was perfect \u2013 which it was.\r\n\r\nIf you want motorised water sports, shops, entertainment each evening and \u201ccosta coffee\u201d then we would suggest you look at some of the other resorts. If you love beauty and nature, are relaxed and content in the company of those you are on holiday with and want the ultimate switch off then we can\u2019t recommend anywhere better to visit that Mirihi.\r\n\r\nSimon & Sue Warwood","text":"As a couple we have had the privilege of being able to stay in a number of the recognised top hotels in the world all of which have been fantastic.

To be greeted by your first name by many of the managing staff sets the tone for this incredibly friendly resort.\r\n\r\nEvery single person we encountered were friendly, helpful & exhibited a great sense of humour. None of obsequiousness of some high end resorts. Special thanks go to Urs, Alexa, Saeed, Fernando & chef Alex. Urs even arranged for us to watch England beat Australia in the rugby World Cup which is about the only thing that kept us out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe water villas are beautiful, designed to be contemporary but completely in keeping with their surroundings. Nothing beats direct access to the sea & reef via steps from your own deck. We only had 3 nights here sadly so didn\u2019t go on any excursions but other guests we spoke to highly recommended them.\r\n\r\nWhat we can recommend is sunset cocktails in the Mauraka bar & restaurant. Do you watch the sunset or the baby reef sharks circling the bar, both are amazing.\r\n\r\nOnly one negative & that is you\u2019ll have to go on a diet once you leave unless you have incredible will power to resist the amazing food. Every night the menu was different & offered a huge variety of options, all cooked to a very high standard with amazing ingredients; foie gras from France for example.\r\n\r\nMirihi will push the budget but so worth it.\r\n\r\nIt really is paradise!","text":"From the moment you take off your shoes on arrival till sadly you have to put them back on to leave the island every one of your wishes will be catered for often before you\u2019ve even thought of it yourself!

The staff are possibly the most friendly and efficient i have ever encountered anywhere in the world , and simply refuse to say 'no' to any request .We stayed in an over water sunset villa which was very spacious , luxuriously appointed and had all the modern touches , all controlled by an Ipad . Breakfast is very good with excellent selection of hot and cold options , lunch we normally took at the Mura bar and particularly enjoyed trying the local reef fish which was always so fresh and delicious , our favourite evening restaurant was Saoke , which has an amazing setting with baby sharks and ray swimming around just feet away from you - the food is also spectacular . My daughter adored the kids club , where the staff were brilliant -they also have movie evenings for the children which she particularly enjoyed . We all cant wait to return as soon as possible - many thanks to the whole Joali team for such a great stay !","text":"Absolutely loved our stay at this relatively new resort , no expense has been spared and every little detail oozes class.

We have been lucky and fortunate enough to travel to more than a few and have enjoyed every stay. But this stay in particular was something that left us absolutely shocked. From the moment you get off the plane to the escort to the Joali sea plane lounge and all the way to the fine detail of your entire trip you are treated with extreme luxury and hospitality.\r\n\r\nNever have we arrived to a resort and the top member whether it\u2019s the manager on duty or the general manager of the hotel greeted us with such a welcoming hello. From that moment we knew that we were in for a treat. The rooms, well they speak for themselves as they are absolutely phenomenal with every little detail being attended to. Before you know if and by the second day the entire staff will know everything you like wherever you sit and will be prepared for it. There absolutely isn\u2019t something that you can request that they won\u2019t try their best to do for you.\r\n\r\nThe restaurants were also a treat as we tried Bellini, soake, and even had a beautiful experience at Her Kitchen.\r\nSoake is not only one of the best restaurants we have had in the Indian Ocean but definitely one of the top five Japanese restaurants we\u2019ve had overall. The executive chef of the resort is extremely well travelled and has a team that is very well prepared throughout the entire resort to make all your dining fantasies come true. On our final day, our experience at Her Kitchen where we got to cook traditional Maldivian cuisine which was also amazing as we not only were very involved but we very much enjoyed everything we made as well!\r\n\r\nAbove all, there are no words I could use to describe how amazing our Jadugar Yaser was. He was always Around whether we needed him or not and was always doing everything he can to make sure that our entire trip was the best possible. He stopped at nothing to make sure that we smiled from the moment we woke up to the moment he dropped us off to sleep and while celebrating my fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday he put forth such a big effort to help me make it such a memorable and amazing experience! Thank you Yaser, we truly hope to see you again soon!\r\n\r\nTo the entire Joali Maldives team, thank you for making our experience, something we will never forget for the rest of our life. Thank you for making our next trip to the Indian Ocean so much easier because there will be no other destination that we would ever pick other than you.","text":"Travelling to beautiful resorts in the Indian Ocean has always been something my fianc\u00e9 and I always look forward to.

The individual private villas are so chic and comfortable. Highlights include expansive views of the Indian Ocean, private pool and a glass floor in changing area.\r\n\r\nThe most surprising of all is that the food on the island was world class. This is a huge task giving that everything has to be shipped to the island as there are no natural resources. The quality of food is on par with any big city like NYC. To note, I especially enjoyed the casual restaurant by the food where the limited menu is all down to perfection. But there are about 11 restaurants you can try.\r\n\r\nWether it\u2019s for a romantic couples get away or a family trip, this island has it all.","text":"Everything you\u2019ve ever imagined the Maldives to be is true and more at the Waldorf Astoria.

I heard that 10\/15 is reopening and 11\/1 is official-opening. I booked resort through the official website from October 21 to 27. The official-opening date was postponed to November, so I was worried about whether I should book another resort. So, I sent the e-mail to the resort, and they confirmed that I am able to stay. We became the first customer to visit Marriott Maldives. They offered me so many congratulations and services because it was my birthday and honeymoon. Thanks to theirs kindness, I was able to have a very happy and fun vacation.\r\n\r\nRoom : I booked 6 nights as an Overwater, but the resort offered me an upgraded room with membership, so I stayed in a mix of Overwater Sunsetview and Beach Villa. As a result, I was very satisfied. I recommend you stay in a mix. The condition of resort is excellent and the resort cleans the room meticulously. I was so grateful for cleaning the spacious room with sincerity.\r\n\r\nFood: I visited the opened every restaurant, all dishes was delicious. I think that it is famous restaurant in the Maldives. I am very strict about food, but I was satisfied with all the food I ordered. I made a reservation Thai restaurant and ate it again on the last day because Thai restaurant food was so delicious on the first day. Beef and seafood was delicious, and the recommend wine was also excellent. The pizza which I ate at the main swimming pool was delicious, and the pasta was also great. I was so satisfied with beef burger and chicken that I ordered for room service. I cannot list all food I've eaten, but I am sure that everyone will get fat. Everything is so delicious. If you order breakfast except for basic buffet, they cook for you. I ate breakfast 6 times and all dish was so great. I recommend kung pao chicken and Maldivian breakfast.\r\n\r\nWater sport center and yoga : I did guide snorkeling for second day, and it was so fun. So, I did Turtle Quest on a fine day. I saw two big turtles so I was excited. I think that I am into snorkeling fun. On the last day, It's too bad, so I did sunset fishing, the staffs helps me catch fish. If you want, they will cook the fish you caught. I had frill for lunch the next day and It was so delicious. If you want, you can use kayaking and paddle boarding for free. I did yoga for 3 days. I was grateful to teacher for saying many good things.\r\n\r\nUnderwater environment : I snorkeled because the weather was nice on the second day in Watervilla, and I saw a lot of fish. I saw also baby sharks often. There are many fish near beach. I saw a lot of fish when I was eating breakfast. I also saw many pretty fish when I snorkeled. On the last day, I was very lucky because I saw dolphins in the Thai restaurant.\r\n\r\nButler : It is why I am writing review. It is really all possible there. Everything is possible at the resort. I suddenly requested to do an activity, but he helped me do it all. So, I was really touched by the service. I want to say thank you to Butler AREY again. I never forget for his kindness.\r\n\r\nEvery staff in the resort were kind, and I was really satisfied with the pictures which photographer took. Spa was also great.

We were disappointed by the misleading advertisement and it caused some confusion when we arrived at the resort.

The abundance of fish soon took my mind of everthing else. We saw turtles, sharks, stingrays, and the clear clear water.... was absolutely amazing. Also had a day trip fishing using a string - I was one of the lucky ones to catch a fish! Meals at the resort was varied and good, altho the meats were a bit on the tough side. Service was excellent.

Following a tour of Sri Lanka it was an utter contrast to our road trip and activities over the previous two and a half weeks. You can walk the island barefoot as everywhere is sand and best of all no cars. Just one delivery truck! It is beautifully maintained and the accommadation stunning especially the bathroom - we had a deluxe beach villa so just a few steps onto the beach from our room. The Spice restaurant offers an excellent variety of buffet for all meals; happily for us always some curry. There is nothing quite like eating breakfast on a wooden deck over turquoise seas watching rays and baby reef shark at breakfast. We had a small misunderstanding about the fine dining experience as one night a buffet is offered there too, not anticipated when we booked our dinner. However, this surprise was dealt with so well by the staff on the evening, and followed up by the manager the next day that all we can say is thank you for such gracious and exemplary service. It was quite simply an outstanding response to a minor issue. The house reef surrounding this island means you are literally getting into a huge tropical acquarium to snorkel or dive. We do not have PADI but the snorkelling experience made an introductory shallow dive feel superflous to our needs. I loved every moment, especially in the water with the millions of different fish, turtles, rays and even the few larger sharks who swam close by. A magical stay.","text":"Our stay at OBLU was the last few days of our holiday.

How about I want to go back as soon as possible! Everything about Kanuhura was a dream. From the moment we landed in Male we were greeted my a Kanuhura member that helped us with our bags and checked us in to our sea plane journey to the island. The lounge was comfortable and we relaxed there for a half hour and freshened up. Once we landed in Kanuhura we were greeted by the staff with some music and welcome drinks. Then our amazing villa host Arshad whisked us away on an island tour which lasted less than 15 minutes :). This island is just the right size, not huge where you feel lost, and not tiny where it lacks facilities. It was just right. The food at the various restaurants was awesome. The variety of food at the breakfast buffet really impressed. The drinks at Iru and Cowry bar were incredible. The attention to detail and every aspect of customer service was unreal. Thank you Armin and the dive shop for a wonderful dive. While my wife and I were diving, the kids were entertained at the kids club. They had a great time riding around on their bikes and exploring the island. They were so excited to see with rays, turtles, sharks, fish, bats and other marine life around the property. Off season is when I'm going again, the were probably 60 guests the whole time were there and it really felt like we were on our own island. Januhura (the private island next door) was stunning. The lunch! the views! I really lost track of time which never happens. In a few short words : WE WANT TO GO BACK!!. Thank you to all the staff that were so kind and always had smiles on their faces. Thank you Clancy for running an amazing resort. Special thanks to Arshad (villa host).

At the bar was JMOHAJAM really took good care of us as well as our infants. Peter from the club really guided us well with the rief available around the island and it was quite good. Prakash ji from the back office showed us around the service area which I was very much interested in. Jasmin really helped us and made my daughter 1st bday very memorable for us. Nothing much to complain except two things the room service before 7 am not much available room service staff needs to be upgraded. 2ndly the water activities or the photographer is very expensive at this resort.

If you can afford the splurge, DO IT! The privacy, living space and wide back deck made it feel like a home away from home. We saw some other rooms too- all were modern and clean with great amenities.\r\nThe service was impeccable with absolutely nothing that was too much trouble to organise. I would definitely recommend asking for a back of house tour, it was very interesting to see how the island is powered, how waste is disposed of and how they create and store water.\r\nThe food. OMG the food. Yes it was buffet style but it was restaurant quality. Freshly cooked soups, noodles, curries etc in front of you. Lots to choose from and catering to a variety of tastes (and spiciness!).\r\nThe staff were always smiling and eager for a chat. When you came upon them and they didn't know you were around, they were still laughing and having a good time which is definitely a positive. What an experience to learn about different customs, families and cultures!\r\nThe reef itself was just outside our door and it was a quick snorkel to the drop off where we saw an amazing array of large and small fish. On our final evening, we went on a night snorkel which was incredible and not as scary as it sounds!\r\nAlthough travelling in late August\/early September, we had perfect weather. 28-32C each day, one morning with some rain and half a day of thunderstorms and that was it. The rain certainly didn't dampen the experience- snorkelling in the rain was lovely! It was a laugh hearing the staff apologise for the rain! :-)\r\n\r\nThings to remember:\r\n-The sun is SUPER hot and you will get sunburned unless you reapply sunscreen regularly. The atoll sits directly on the equator!\r\n-Book your house reef tour the day you arrive if possible and borrow fins and snorkels to use for the duration of your stay.\r\n-The beach BBQ is a must- amazing seafood and well worth the additional expense.\r\n-The domestic airport near the resort is teeny tiny and doesn't have toilet paper- carry tissues!\r\n-Keep an eye on the tides. We found for the most part that the morning tides were smoother and should have tried stand up paddle boarding a little earlier in the day!\r\n-You wont need any shoes except for thongs\/flip flops. Really!\r\n\r\nWe really hope that one day we will be able to return to the perfection that was Amari Havodda Maldives.","text":"From the moment we were met at the airport to the moment we were waved off at the end of our stay, everything was magical.\r\nWe stayed in room 120- one of the two over water villas with a pool.

For years I have longed to travel to the Maldives and was a bit concerned that when I eventually did it might not live up to my expectations. However the fact we stayed at Milaidhoo Island meant that everything was beyond my expectations and this was truly a holiday of a lifetime. Everything from the moment we walked through the arrival gates till we headed to departures was faultless. I don\u2019t think I have ever felt so relaxed and at home while away from home as I did at Milaidhoo. The Milaidhoo family are exceptional. The water villa was so well designed with everything we needed. The decking area with swinging sofa and infinity pool was perfect and we spent lovely lazy days there. The food was some of the tastiest I have ever had. I was overwhelmed with the choices at breakfast. The island itself is small but beautiful. We had regular walks around the island and explored it well. I had never snorkelled before and fell in love with snorkelling. I was mesmerised by the colours and amount of fish and sea life. Why have I waited this long to try it? We had a trip with the marine biologist which was great. We also tried the kayaks one day. We visited the spa for a couples massage which was the best massage I have experienced. The setting obviously contributed to that. It was my birthday while there and I was made to feel so special with a champagne breakfast served in our villa, a lovely meal at Ba\u2019theli and then the surprise of our bed decorated with a birthday message, a present and a photograph. I can see why people return to Milaidhoo and hope to be lucky enough to return too sometime soon.

I took my elderly parents so I wanted peaceful rather than party and obviously value. I really feel that we got exactly what we all wanted and more and although I would like to go somewhere different next time I will remember an amazing holiday on Dhigali. There was only one thing that I would criticise and that was the stretch of beach in front of our villa. Quite obviously the best stretch of sand is in front of the most expensive villas but it was pretty tricky for my parents to get in and out of the water near our villas as it was obstructed by tree roots and branches. Never mind, it's a short walk over to the other side and the beach in front of the restaurants was very nice, complete with beach buzzers for service.\r\nI had the dine around all inclusive as I don't mind a few cocktails during the day and I'm not a buffet fan. The buffet was very nice though with plenty of choices but the restaurants were much better.We mainly ate in Jade for lunch as we were near the pool and Faru for dinner with a few pre-dinner drinks in the Haali Bar which is just beautiful at sunset.\r\nThe island was a good size too, my parents took the buggy sometimes which is great to follow on the Dhigali tracker app but if you are younger you would just stroll as the vegetation is beautiful.\r\nAbsolutely well organised with the sea planes also as I read some horror stories. On our arrival at the airport we were taken to check in and then sent to the lounge, everything went down very smoothly from beginning to end.\r\nAs I said, this was my first time in the Maldives so I have nothing else to compare but it was a wonderful time and great value. The other guests were completely mixed from families to couples from all over the world and everyone seemed to be relaxed, friendly and having a great time too.\r\nThumbs up Dhigali, the company who own this island should be very grateful to their team of employees for providing such memorable experiences for their guests.","text":"I think I am the same as most avid first timers to the maldives, literally after hundreds of hours of research I settled on Dhigali.

We had 4 sunloungers to ourselves, 2 on our deck and 2 on the beach right in front of our bungalow. Heavenly. We loved the walks to breakfast and the restaurants on the island through shady greenery. Breakfast had plenty of choice. You get 2 free bottles of water each day. We chose the bed breakfast option. We enjoyed coffee in Dhayavaru but the cakes, pizza and club sandwich were not good at all (dry) and were too expensive. Food prices on the island were higher than we expected and at least $5 - $10 more per item than Reethi Beach prices. Reethi Grill was amazing. We enjoyed every mouthful here. The paneer curry and the butter chicken were fabulous. We did not eat at the pool bar but we enjoyed a beer here. Snorkelling was good. Some of the coral is bleached but there were plenty of fish and we saw a turtle. Definately plenty to see while snorkelling in the right places. The service and staff here were great.

It's a place you can only dream of.\r\n\r\nWhen we landed in Male, we were quickly greeted by one of the Baros team and whisked away onto a speed boat which took us to the island. It took about 20 minutes, and you're offered drinks along the way.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, it was just stunning! We were greeted straight away with a glass of champagne and welcomed by some of the team before being shown to our villa.\r\n\r\nWe opted for the one of the water villas which was well worth the money! It was absolutely stunning. Our villa host Asim told us all of the information we needed about the room and the island, and all of the things you could do on the island. There are so many activities you can do, or you can do absolutely nothing. The choice is yours!\r\n\r\nDuring our stay we ate twice at the Lighthouse (my favourite). I would highly recommend the lobster bisque. We also ate Cayanne Grill (which wasn't worth the price in my opinion) and were treated to dinner on the beach as were there on our honeymoon. It was delightful and we were served by a lovely guy called Muaz who made sure our evening went without a hitch. Breakfast is served daily in the Lime Restaurant and is wonderful. One day the chefs even made us a indian breakfast after making a special request! We also ate lunch there, as well as in the Sail Bar. As you'd expect the food we ate was out of this world.\r\n\r\nIf you do nothing else whilst on your stay, you must try snorkelling. You can see some incredible sea creatures, and can even swim with sharks (although we didn't see any while we were out). It's stunning!\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a lively island then Baros is not for you. It's so peaceful, you can go all day without seeing anyone at meal times, but it's also got lots on offer should you want to fill your days.\r\n\r\nA big thank you to Asim who looked after us throughout our stay and nothing was ever too much trouble! However saying that, every single person we encountered during our stay treated us like kings (and queen).

Firstly I would like to thank the staff for their amazing attention to detail to list some are hassan, armikka som, moofa, ramses and the list goes on they are all a credit to this resort and make it the 5 star experience it is. The island itself is spectacular and the activities can keep you busy at all times. The food is amazing and the drink options are great and are refilled before you have the chance to get near the bottom.\r\n\r\nEven though I have given it 5 stars there are a few recommendations i would suggest to the management. On more than one occasion we came across rubbish in the sea whilst snorkling around the water villas we picked them up and bought them back to the room but it might have been handy to have had a little bag to put it in in order to bring it back. Our villa had a few loose\/broken tiles on the pool not the end of the world but if someone had stood on it it could have been dangerous. The buggies can go quite fast past your villa first thing in the morning which woke my husband up on a couple of occasions fairly early so maybe a speed limit up till 9am might be a good idea. Food was thrown to the fish (i doubt it was staff but guests should be discouraged from doing this)but I'm pretty sure fish can't eat whole donuts as they floated past our villa a few times. The palms closed at lunch for refurbishment ( which I don't begrudge) but there was a lot more variety there food wise and although eating at the traditions restaurant was amazing it did kind of devalue the experience there of an evening for us Plus there was a lot more options at the palms including a vegan station that was no longer available after the lunch closure and my husband who enjoyed the grilled fresh fish at lunch could only get it on the friday gala evening.\r\n\r\nAll that being said our stay was amazing. I love how they are so environmentally conscious they were.. paper straws, paraben free sunscreen, refilled glass waterbottles. Will definitely go again loved the musical chairs and flairing of a friday evening it was a lot of fun.","text":"My husband and I just got back from 2 weeks at this resort.

This resort has become one of the most beloved of all Maldives resorts, and offers affordable All-Inclusive holidays in a truly blissful setting.","hotel_info":"<h2><strong>Embudu Village - Overview<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Embudu Village ethos is to maintain an easy laidback atmosphere that welcomes in guests to make the island their home. The resort is in the South Mal\u00e9 Atoll surrounded by turquoise waters. All the staff at Embudu Village go out the way to make guests feel at ease and comfortable. The easy-going nature of the resort allows you to relax, take in the scenery and explore the island. The resort is very conscious of environmental impact and therefore has implemented many innovative ways to reduce this. Your morning shower is heated by solar panels, your breakfast fruit is grown on a nearby island, and the fish at dinner is caught responsibly by local fishermen. The house reef is also gently cared for and maintained to ensure that guests can continue to enjoy the natural beauty without disturbing the marine inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOnly a short boat ride away from some of the best diving site in the Maldives the diving centre offers courses for beginners and advanced divers. On diving boat trips, you can spot sharks, manta rays, turtles and more. For a more relaxing day head over to the island\u2019s resident spa Serene which offers indulgent beauty and wellness treatment for mind, body and soul rejuvenation. However, for a day full of adventure take one of Embudu Village\u2019s tailored excursions where you can snorkel, visit local islands or enjoy some authentic fishing.\r\n\r\nThe villas at Embudu Village are either nestled amongst the palm trees of the beach or perched above the lagoon waters. All the villas in the island have four-poster beds to sink into and are filled with thoughtful modern comforts. The beach villas are airy and bright with rustic timber flourishes and classic whitewashed walls and are perfectly situated for taking a morning stroll along the sandy beach. The water villas are indulgently comfortable and even feature a glass pane in the floor where you can view the shoals of vibrant tropical fish swimming by.\r\n\r\nYour breakfast lunch and dinner at Embudu Village is served at their all-day buffet style restaurant. The dining theme changes each night with a focus on sourcing local fresh ingredients to be prepared by award-winning chefs to provide guests with a laid-back flavourful experience that pays homage to the Maldivian experience. There are also \u00e0 la carte options for special celebrations like fresh lobster.

Once there patrice was very welcoming and provided all the info needed plus some extras included in our premium all inclusive. The watervilla was amazing and the views are breathtaking. The staff was super nice and helpfull specially Sattar on the pool area who everyday was surprising us with his flowers skills and even did a photoshoot with us (always willing to go over). Malandi on the bar area was friendly too and great drinks and coctails were done by him. And last but not least Suleiman in the restaurant was incredible (our last dinner on the beach was fantastic). I most mention the 75% of the island is being renovated but does not affect your stay and you cant hear noise at all. Only areas open are the watervillas, the restaurant buffet, The beach, the surf bar or pasta point and the infinite pool but that is more than enough to have a great time. The food was tasty but I most say after few days it gets repetitive so my feedback will be to change the food options more often. We wish to come back again one day!

We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we could not have picked a more perfect place. From the minute we landed in Male we were met by a hotel representative who checked us in for our seaplane flight and showed us to a private lounge area while we waited for our flight. As we came into land we could see a fantastic welcome party and what a welcome we had .. I cried, it was so wonderful! We were greeted by our personal guest services representative, Ruvini and the manager on duty with a glass of champagne. From the minute we arrived until the minute we left (I cried again!) we had the most amazing time. We were treated like royalty and nothing was too much trouble, the staff are just wonderful. A special mention to Gobi for the amazing drinks and the absolute master piece he created for us on our anniversary. Naufaul (apologies if I've spelt this wrong) and Vincent our wonderful waiters who we looked forward to seeing at lunch and dinner when at the Spice buffet. The food is wonderful, we ate at Just Veg and the Sunset A La Carte restaurant and we had an amazing meal at the Teppanyaki restaurant on our anniversary.

I don\u2019t think it gets any better for a family holiday with small kids. The only bit of advice I would give is to make contact with your client liaison in advance of your trip and book a few excursions and restaurants upfront. The restaurants in particular fill up very quickly and you could miss out. Bicycles are also in serious demand so if you want to cycle around, book them early. Our client liaison, Charitha, took fantastic care of us, always available on WhatsApp and met us most mornings to discuss excursions and bookings. The main pool area, Liquid, is fantastic and you could spend your entire week at the pool. They serve delicious fish and chips from 17:00 \u2013 19:00 but otherwise drinks only. The buffet breakfasts, lunches and dinners at Spice are out of this world. There are other fantastic restaurants to choose from all over the island. Ceylon Bliss is a Sri Lankan street bar right on the beach and the food is amazing \u2013 it\u2019s included in the package and you don\u2019t need to book. Just Veg serves incredible vegetarian food on a deck overlooking rock pools (not included in the package). Teppanyaki serves Japanese dishes and steaks and the chef puts on a show for the family with also sorts of acrobatics and flames \u2013 the kids loved it (not included in the package). We really enjoyed going snorkeling, fishing and the sunset cruise. All on boats which leave the jetty at set times. The excursions aren\u2019t too long, usually 30 minutes there, an hour snorkeling or fishing and then another 30 minutes to get back. The service, friendliness and efficiency of the staff across the board is quite special. Best beach holiday we have had by a long shot.","text":"Atmosphere Kanifushi is just incredible.

Arrived on our sea plane from Male to be welcomed by some very smily staff who took us the short hop on the boat to the island and were handed a very cold face towel which was so refreshing after our long journey. Taken to reception and one of the guest services came to speak to us about our check in. The first thing to delight us was confirmation that my request to be placed in a water villa on the North side of the island had been accommodated and we were allocated room 321. The water villas are amazing and for us a must have. Gave us the best of both worlds having privacy with our own decking and access straight into the turquoise sea but also being able to sit on the beach when we wanted. In my opinion the north end of the island is the\r\nmost beautiful. It\u2019s child free which I wasn\u2019t too bothered about before we went but does make a nice difference. The food was great the best nights for us being the Tex Mex night and Indian although every day was excellent. We were very impressed on the first day the chef speaking to us about the chilli allergy we had and making sure we understood the ingredient signage.\r\nThe house reef is amazing with us losing count of the number of different fish we saw. The coral is a bit dead looking in places but it must be regenerating given the amount of marine life. Snorkelling is the best I\u2019ve done outside of Australia.\r\nWent on a couple of boat trips that are included in the All Inclusive package (The sunset cruise and the trip to a local island). Both were worth it although the time on the local island could have been cut by 30 mins but on the sunset cruise we saw quite a number of dolphins.\r\nThe spa ladies are lovely and I spent 2 hours having the deluxe package treatment which was worth every penny.\r\nAll in all this is was one of our best holidays ever and we have returned relaxed and recharged.\r\nThere are a lot of Maldivian islands to choose from but if you love snorkelling and want value for money this is the one to go for we will be back.","text":"Just returned home from a fantastic 10 night stay in an overwater villa and from start to finish the whole experience was amazing.

The food was great, there wasn't a vast choice but you could always find something that suited.\r\nThere was lots of dead coral around the island, but it was nice to see some new growth, we frequently saw turtles, black tip sharks and nurse sharks (there are no tiger sharks in this area). It was interesting to see that other nearby islands did snorkelling trips to Biyadhoo reef as it was much better than there own.\r\nWe did the complimentary sunset fishing trip and all 10 of us on the trip caught fish.\r\nIt was lovely to see the large fruit bats flying around, the island is very lush with flora and fauna hence the bats and bird life. There is the most amazing tree right on the beach which acts as natural shade from the sun.\r\nI would recommend that cushions are provided for the sun loungers as it was very uncomfortable laying on hard plastic for any length of time.\r\nFor the seven days we were on Biyadhoo we had a mixed bag of weather, it rained most nights, we had a few cloudy starts to the days but when the sun did come out it was boiling hot, and yes we did get sunburnt when it was cloudy, so watch out.\r\nWe travelled on from Biyadhoo to Rannalhi Island for another seven days which I will review separately.\r\nI would say this islands is great value especially for the all inclusive.","text":"Our stay was from 7th October - 15th October.\r\nWe have stayed at many islands in the Maldives, and on reading other reviews we expected very basic rooms and facilities, and this is exactly what we got, the rooms need quite a bit of updating, I will say that the air conditioning was one of the quietest I have know on any other islands.

He took us straight to the check in for seaplane and we were chauffeured to the private seaplane lounge within 5 minutes of coming through.\r\nThe length of the seaplane journey (approx 80 mins) Prior to getting there I thought would be a downside but I was completely wrong. This was an amazing experience flying over all the atolls and islands until you eventually reach our own piece of paradise.\r\nWe got off the seaplane to a fantastically warm welcome complete with Maldivian drums and cool face towels.\r\nThe check in process was faultless, once again our experience host Malika knew who we were without any information! We were given a tour of the island via golf buggy before being taken to our amazing water villa!\r\nThe villa was absolutely fantastic and completely blew me away! Well decorated, spacious and beautiful. I was worried we would be too close to the villa next door before arriving but this was not an issue. We had a fantastic cleaner moosa h who came twice a day to clean the room and left everything spotless and lovely.\r\nMy husband was sick whilst we were there (not from anything related to the island) and the care we received was fantastic. We were seen by the island dr and nurse who looked after us. All the island staff asked after my husband and malika (our fabulous experience host) went above the call of duty by making sure he had fresh soup and warm milk and honey bought to the room. I can not explain how much these little touches make.\r\nThe food in all the restaurants was delicious and the staff are so friendly. You really feel like you are part of an island family. Everybody was so welcoming and caring.\r\nWe were on the all inclusive package and the alcohol included was very good with a wide range of options and not just your basic spirits. Most food was included, usual exclusions of lobster but that was about it.\r\nI really can not fault this island and would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone. I was really sad to leave and still have the post holiday blues.\r\nKaren you are so lucky to have such a fantastic team, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

JA Manafaru stands out due to it's impeccable service. The staff is genuinely warm, caring and friendly. They tailor to every travellers needs from the moment you book your trip, till the moment you depart.\r\n\r\nEvery guest has an experience host who tends to your needs, assists you in organising all your events and reservations. You are also picked up in a buggy to get around the resort. Our host was Ziraar. He is incredibly kind and takes notes of everything you need through out your stay. He (and every one else) goes out of their way to make you comfortable.\r\n\r\nEach villa is designed with a great eye for detail and well equipped. The cleanliness is noteworthy and our housekeeper was Muneez. Our bungalow was cleaned twice a day and there were alway nice and funny surprises.\r\n\r\nThe resort has multiple restaurants with a variety of cuisines which go beyond any resort we have visited. Each dish is creatively put together and the chef and waiters remember your little preferences during each meal. The bars also create lovely and personal cocktails and ensure that you are deeply satisfied (thank you Satish)\r\n\r\nThere are different locations and areas on the resort keeping you occupied during your stay, but there is a general calm vibe through out. There are bikes and buggies to get you around. Multiple pools and bars, a diving center, lounges, excursions, chill zones and much more.\r\n\r\nThe resort is also very child friendly. I will definitely be returning with our little one. I have to commend Karen and Melania (General manager and Executive Manager) for their excellent welcome and kindness. Waiter Yassin, so funny but very attentive to detail and like many others, made us feel right at home. Unfortunately there are some people whose names I cannot remember :-( but the head of F&B and his assistant, the chef, the lovely waitress from Nepal, thank you so much.\r\n\r\nWe saw a lot of sea life and this was an excellent baby moon.

The food is divine, the service is personalised and yet there is no expectation of needing to 'dress for dinner'; relaxed familes and couples enjoy their meals in comfort and flip flops. The beautiful beach bungalows boast beautiful dark wooden furniture and traditionally woven roofing but also quiet and efficient air conditioning and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The gardens and beach are beautifully maintained. Even the house reef, which suffered from bleaching like so many, is still populated with friendly turtles, jewel-like fish and shy reef sharks, making for excellent snorkelling. There is also a multilingual and skilful Dive team and opportunities for water sports.\r\nThere are some staff who have worked there for twenty years and also a new management team who are keen to preserve the magic of Makunudu and keep improving the offer.\r\nI very much hope to return in future but in the meantime, cannot recommend this place highly enough to travellers wishing to relax and unwind.","text":"We have just returned from our second visit to this beautiful island sanctuary, where we had a truly restorative and rejuvenating break.

Our airport pick up was fast and seamless. The island facilities and rooms have a clean, understated vibe that goes well with the island setting (and should be even better after the renovation!). We chose this location for the house reef and it did not disappoint. We went snorkeling every day and saw an incredible quantity and variety of fish. You can see baby reef sharks, fish, and big rays all from your room! I also recommend the shark snorkeling tour - just a 10 min boat ride to see reef sharks swimming - it was one of our highlights!\r\n\r\nThe food and service was excellent as well. The staff did a great job of being attentive but didn't go overboard and the result was that we felt perfectly secluded with help when needed (we're not a couple that enjoys overt attention like a private Butler so this was perfect for us). I'd like to specifically call out the bar staff of Palitha and Ravi who made our stay extra enjoyable (and well hydrated!).\r\n\r\nThe only reasons I didn't give 5 stars:\r\n1. There was plastic and trash that washed up on the shore every day. While this was absolutely not from the Como resort they could have put more people in charge of going around the small island a few times per day to clear this.\r\n2. The staff at the watersports center acted a bit put off with some \"last minute\" requests like rigging the small sailboat when wind came, or us asking to join a snorkel tour on the day of. While I understand that it's easier for them to plan if we call ahead, for an island this small it shouldn't be that difficult to accommodate (which they always did in the end).\r\n\r\nHowever these were very small details that didn't affect our enjoying this beautiful island. If you're looking for an easy to get to Maldives island with good diving\/snorkeling and food this is a good choice for you. Highly recommended and we would definitely come back.","text":"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights and we're very happy with experience. Our airport pick up was fast and seamless.

Green and full of life... birds, from the Grey Heron, a solitaire on each Maldivian island, usually called George, facing every morning the sun not yet raised, to the Waterhens, drinking water on the edge of your private pool... And, yes, the bats, the flying foxes, so cute but so shy, difficult to catch with your camera, with their spectacular extended wings during the flights from the top of the highest palm to the next coconut tree.\r\nAnd so much different one to each other: Chill, so quiet, with over-the-water villas on the ocean side, including the secluded Crescent, but also with wonderful beach villas, on the lagoon side, facing sunset, with private pool, with their green yards opening to the beach, that beach with the whitest and finest sand we've ever seen (and we've seen a lot of beaches around the world !), beach which is lazy oozing into the incredible light-green sea... and Play, which, beyond the great villas, is hosting a lot of activities. The largest playground for children on a Maldivian island, very well equipped for any age, where the parents may escape the care for children for the whole day long and enjoy an unexpected new honeymoon... A tennis court, a badminton court... And, the most spectacular, the Surf Shack, the most western point of Niyama, with a small bar and some long-chairs where you can lay and enjoy a drink while watching the incredible sunsets... This is a place of surf, where surfers, from beginners to pro, are waiting for the high waves of the ocean. There is also a kind of an open air Hall of Fame of the famous surfers who came here, including a World Champion, surfers who donated their surf boards, as a memento of their performance.\r\n\r\n'Niyama', the name so well chosen, means, among a lot of other meanings, \u201crecommended activities and hobbits for healthy living\u201d and \u201cliberated state of existence\u201d. Or, simply, the nickname \u201cNature's Playground\u201d. And, yes, it is true.\r\n\r\nAbout villas... incredible how many types of villas could be on these two small islands. From Beach Villas, with or without private pool, one or two bedrooms, to the outstanding Three Bedroom Beach Pool Pavilion, with two private pools, spa treatment room, and... nanny room... And Water Villas from Water Pool Villas to Two Bedrooms Ocean Pool Pavilion...\r\nWe've chosen a Beach Pool Villa. Villa no.9. Better than any other we've seen from the beach. Sunset oriented, facing calm lagoon waters (instead the nervous ocean waters, on the sunrise side), it was perfect for a couple. Large to the extension of our needs, yet not to get lost in it, modern but not minimalist, with a great green yard, embracing the private pool (so refreshing when coming back from sea and beach), assuring privacy by its less than 1.5 meters wide opening to the beach and sea... With a serene inner backyard, extension of a modern open bath room, with flowers falling calmly on the water mirror, on the way to the so much beloved open air shower... a covered terrace with a large swing to lay on... what else could you possible need ?\r\nInside the room, all necessary facilities: wi-fi (a good one, thank God !), a nice Bose System, to which I've connected my iPod with the music we love, a large TV (which we've never used it !), a Nespresso coffee machine (free, of course) and a huge full fridge. The ice cream (free, of course), together with the daily fresh fruit basket (free, of course), followed by a non-alcoholic cocktail (too hot for alcohol in day time !), usually our invention, the Ginger Virgin Mojito, from Dune Bar, just two minutes away on the beach, and, of course, a good coffee, all these were a good and healthy alternative to a lunch, between a huge breakfast and a great dinner.\r\nAbout breakfast and dinner.\r\nSix restaurants (including one at 500 m far from the islands, and one six meters deep into the sea), four (or five ?!) bars... all of them on these two small islands.\r\nBreakfast, at one of the two all-day-dining restaurants (Epicure on Chill and Blu on Play). Great. Complete. Best. Continental, Indian, Far East (Thai, Japanese, Chinese), any kind of egg dishes you can imagine, all kind of bacon, smoked fish, cheese, honey (from honeycomb to Manuka), a lot of sweets, a lot of fruits (so good papaya and passion fruits), coffee, tea, fresh squeezed juice and... sparkling wine.\r\nAnd the people...so attentive, so friendly, so careful... \u201cHave you a small problem with your throat ? Let us bring a ginger-lemon-honey hot drink to you.\u201d\r\nBut, about the people, later, on below...\r\nFor our two weeks stay, we've chosen a half-board meal plan: breakfast and dinner.\r\nThat includes dinner in Epicure and Blu, buffet type, on thematic evenings (seafood, Thai, Maldivian, Italian...).\r\nThe buffet in Epicure and Blu was great, with a large variety of dishes, live grill stations... difficult to say which evening was better.\r\nFor dinner in the other restaurants (Edge, Nest, Tribal, Subsix), we've got 50$ vouchers per person per dinner. And, these restaurants... what a poetry !\r\nTribal, african \u2013 south-american, game and... lobster, great food, in spread pavilions, most of them with no more than three tables, open-air, with arched ceilings,... so african.\r\nNest, a restaurant... on top of the trees, with separate zones, usually with three tables, linked by catwalks, a la carte or teppanyaki, excellent food, from great Tom Yum and Tom Kha Goong ( we came here four times especially for these Thai spiced soups !) to the incredible Kobe steak, on teppanyaki.Nest is so much interesting, so we came back in day time, to take proper great pictures.\r\nEdge, at 500 meters far from islands, in the middle of the sea, with its conic tent shape, offered a wonderful quiet evening to us, with no wind, no heat, tasting an exceptional seafood platter for two, so huge that we, always very fond of seafood, have surrendered, not possible to finish it.\r\nOn the same platform, in the middle of the sea, is Subsix, the six meters deep restaurant,, with splendid corals housing a lot of fish beyond the glass walls. Interesting in night time, but even more interesting in day time, when we've came back, for a drink and nice pictures.\r\nAll in one, during the two weeks, we've discussed often about the restaurant to choose for each day, as it was not easy at all.\r\n\r\nAs it was our seventh Maldivian holiday, we were a little bit fed up with \u201cactivities\u201d, and were tempted more by swimming in the sea, enjoy the sunshine, refreshing in our pool... We've found out that the day is so short... And, adding the time spent by my wife at Spa (excellent massage specialist, my wife enjoyed massage sessions quite a lot !), our days were shorter than we've hoped they could be.\r\nBut we couldn't stop ourselves to observe how many activities were available. Water activities, from snorkeling and scuba diving, ski jets, kayaks, boards, to surfing. Tennis. Badminton. The Gym, full equipped, where we've been in the only raining afternoon. Cruises. Sunrise cruises, sunset fishing cruises, dolphins, whale shark... a lot of possibilities.\r\n\r\nAs i've mentioned on above, I'd like to dedicate a special part of this review to the people of Niyama. Definitely, the people we've met are the main asset of the resort.\r\nI'd need a lot of words to characterise them: professionals (each of them al his level), efficient, prompt, quick, productive, reliable, helping, friendly, warm... and I may continue.\r\nBut, the most important quality is their team spirit. Working as a team. Acting as a team. Each of them knowing its role, but able to change the place with the next one, where needed, to replace one each other, at the same level, but to remain fused together in a single well-trained team.\r\nI'd like to mention some names. And, as during these two wonderful weeks we've perceived them as our friends, I'll call them by first name only, without title, same as one is calling his friends.\r\nI will start with the top people. Rebeca, the Front Desk Manager, and Siwa, the Operations Manager.\r\nRebeca, she really impressed us. Very professional, capable, efficient, reliable, but friendly, she is the one who keeps everything in her hands and, with the help of Siwa, is running the whole resort smoothly, like a well-oiled, efficient machine. She is finding time and resources to take apart each guest, with its specific needs, to solve these needs in the best way and made each guest to feel himself as the most important guest of Niyama. Very open and direct, eventually we've considered her as our best friend from Niyama.\r\nAnd, yes, she is the one who made us really consider to come back to Niyama as soon as possible. Thank you, Rebeca, for your understanding and support ! Hope to meet you again, soon.\r\nUnfortunately, we couldn't meet the General Manager of the resort, as he was missing from islands for a while, but only two minutes before our leaving seaplane take off. But, shaking hands as farewell, we've congratulated him for his team and urged him to take care of such a great team.\r\nFor every guest, in center stage is the thakuru, the personal butler. Our thakuru was Mahey.\r\nTo be Mahey the best thakuru of Niyama ? For us, he was the best. Prompt, effective, reliable, following and solving our requests in an easy and natural way, as he knows them in advance. He greeted us when we've get off the seaplane (together with resort management, Rebeca, and Siwa...) and drove us with a buggy direct to our villa, where we've made check in. Everything was done in the villa, check in, check out, dinner and Spa reservations. In our villa, not at Reception. Niyama has no Reception. Well, it is a place called Reception, in fact a kind of an open-air meeting room, next to the offices of management and executives. But in this Reception you can not find desks with computers and clerks. All necessary operations are done in the villas, by thakuru. Mahey took care of us. Any time we've called him, he came to pick us up with a buggy, never late, never early. Calm and friendly, with a good sense of humor, Mahey let us the impression that he can not be better. Thank you, Mahey.\r\nBelow Mahey, a lot of people, in the restaurants, at Spa. Just to mention few names.\r\nHabeeb, who hosted us at all our dinners in Nest, and also taking care of us at breakfast in Epicure. Careful, attentive, pro, listening to our requests or to our stories and also telling stories, but never crossing the line, Habeeb make us feel that, if we were not the only guests in the restaurants, we were at least the guests of honor. We may see Habeeb in any Michelin starred restaurant.\r\nTeddy, which we perceived as a maitre d'hotel at breakfast in Epicure, met us every morning with a nice smile, inviting us to a table, as this table was the best and reserved for us only. Friendly, warm, pro, she was the best start for breakfast every morning.\r\nAo (what a nice name !) made my wife to feel herself very well and relaxed at the end of the massage sessions, in Spa. After first session, my wife choose to continue with Ao for all further sessions, and that proved to be a good decision. Very good Spa, very good specialist.\r\nThoha, the housekeeper. He is a special one. Very good, pro, we consider him as a senior housekeeper. Careful, attentive, prompt and quick. Every morning, coming back from breakfast, or every evening, coming back from dinner, we found the villa as new, as it was in our first day.\r\nBut, soon, we've discovered different sides of his personality.\r\nAs my iPod and the Bose system worked very well together, I've asked Thoha if he likes to listen music. He was affirmative. Well, what kind of music ? Classic, he said. Classic ? Are you sure ? First, I've proposed a compromise. Abba ? No, thanks ! he said. Classic ! So that, when we've left the villa to breakfast or dinner we've let running, for him, the Imperial, the Four Seasons, the Swan Lake... It seems that he was quite happy. And we were happy for him.\r\nAnd we found out that Thoha is also drawing ! And his drawings are quite good. What a gifted housekeeper ! Thank you very much, Thoha !\r\n\r\nAll in one, Niyama was our best choice of a Maldivian resort this year. We've spent here two fantastic weeks. And, thinking to our cold winter season, we've really found ourselves in the Seventh Heaven. We'll be back soon ! Niyama... we already miss you !","text":"For our seventh Maldivian holiday, each time at a different top resort, we've made, this year, the best choice, Niyama Private Islands.\r\nAn attractive tandem of two islands, Chill and Play, connected by a bridge, so much alike and though so much different one to each other.\r\nAlike one to each other, as both are so green, so much green, from tall...","nickname":"Constant_Cri_Do"},{"title":"Paradise on Earth with the Best Service","date":"20200111","rating":"5","full_text":"Niyama is absolutely fantastic!

There are only a few games available,so it's not the best choice for families.\r\nThe snorkellig tour is amazing! You see the \"Finding Nemo\" live! :) snorkelling equipment can be rented,and even if you don't take a boat tour,the marine life around the island is very vivid.\r\nYou might need swimshoes because of the corals,but I could manage without it.\r\nFood is excellent,especially for seafood lovers of course :) but there's a great selection of meats and vegetables as well. cocktails are very strong, wine selection is excellent (more,than 120 types available from around the world). Minibar is full of delicious products,you have all you need. Staff is really friendly,cleaniness is perfect, so it's really hard to think of any negative experience :)\r\nThere is a souvenir shop where you can buy necessities (swimsuit,t-shirt,sunscreen,etc) and souvenirs (as for prices, for eg. a fridge magnet is around 8 usd).\r\n\r\nI absolutely recommend this property, eslecially if you are looking for a friendly,leasure place to relax.","text":"I only had 2 nights here, but it was amazing.

The distance is far enough for being away from this busy world but close enough for convenient transit and wonderful sea plane experience especially if you travel with young child.\r\n\r\nSnorkeling is always the priority when I choose a resort in the Maldives. Constance Moofushi did not fail my expectation. I\u2019d like to thank the management team for arranging us to stay at a water villa close to the beautiful house reef because my daughter is not a strong swimmer. The house reef was very nice and some colors were back. Although the dry season had not begun when we were there, the current was not strong and snorkeling was easy. Many different fish could be seen as you may have read about from other comments.\r\n\r\nThe island was not quite big but very comfortable to stay. You got a gorgeous beach, an infinity pool, and a green lagoon, almost every important element for a beach side resort. The room was big enough for three people to stay and the resort also prepared a sofa bed for my daughter. The water villa enjoyed impeccable view of the Indian ocean. The food was good and the culinary team changed menu every day. It was considerate that gluten free food was prepared and marked. The dinner at Alizee was very enjoyable. The chef prepared fusion cuisine with mixture of mordern European catering and oriental elements. The resort organized different excursions. If you travel with kids, dolphin adventure was quite interesting and strongly recommended. Kids may also enjoy sunset fishing.\r\n\r\nFinally I will thank the staff from reception, restaurant, dive center, housekeeping, and actually everybody we met on the island. Staff were definitely the key reason making our stay always happy. Home away from home, yes, service was impeccable in Constance Moofushi. From checking in to checking out, from being picked up at the Male International Airport to boarding your flight back home, you felt the hospitality of the staff. People were always smiling and very polite, friendly and keen to help. I have to mention that because of the delay of TMA\u2019s flight, we could have missed our flight back if there had no seamless service from the resort. Special thanks to Luthi who took care of us a lot, and to other staff like Adil, Sammi.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend Constance Moofushi and we will be back.","text":"I would like to rate Constance Moofushi for 5.\r\n\r\nAfter 25 minutes of sea plane flight from Male, you will arrive Constance Moofushi.

From the moment we landed in Male airport to the moment we left, we were treated amazingly. The service from all staff was exceptional.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived on the island, occupancy was low, less than 40%, which made it feel very exclusive. We never had to queue for anything and all the staff went out of their way to help us. We had a very warm welcome from Sasha and Henri, and Zidane gave us a tour of the island and showed us to our room. We had water villa 137 which was on the end of the walk way and very private with sunset views.\r\n\r\nThe food was always amazing. We ate most nights in the buffet restaurant which was always varied and very tasty. Never a bad meal here. The salads and desserts were outstanding. We also enjoyed the wine & dine night and the meal at the al a carte restaurant. Each night the somelliers were very attentive and looked after us. We made friends with Madu, Marlon and Vishal and they made our evenings special with great wines and wine tastings!\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was great and put on by Dylan who made an effort every evening to find us for a chat. His Sagafi (traditional Maldivian) night was great fun and got all the guests involved, whilst learning a bit about Maldivian culture and history.\r\n\r\nWe also visited the spa a few times and had amazing massages from Kinley, Marie and Murti. We also had a private yoga lesson on our decking!\r\n\r\nI can't fault this island. Treated like friends throughout, with luxury like no other. We cannot wait to return!

Our room was fantastic and looks exactly as in all the pictures. The breakfast is the best layout I've ever seen. We ate at the asian restaurant and the underwater one twice. The meals were excellent. Do not miss snorkeling the house reef. One of the best spots which, in my opinion, rivals snorkeling the great barrier reef. My 4 year old loved the art class so she did it twice. The teacher was so patient with her. I participated in the muay thai workout which was fun. The spa was also nice with relaxing facilities. We also thoroughly enjoyed biking around the island. Overall, I cannot recommend this resort highly enough.

Muay Thai boxing, a well equipped gym, an orchid garden, star observatory, an underwater restaurant, amazing wine list, organic home grown vegetables and herbs, bicycles, art classes, yoga classes, not to mention endless water sports activities and the islands very own coconuts!

After a short speedboat ride from Male, I arrived at Gili and was welcomed by Nicolas, the resort manager and Serene, my Miss Friday. After a tour of the island, I was taken to my room to complete the check-in process.\r\nI stayed in a Villa Suite, which was even better than I had imagined it to be. Split over two floors, you have the option of sleeping under the stars or in the bedroom downstairs. I loved just sitting out on the deck, watching the sunrise and listening to the ocean. No other hotel room will ever compare to this!\r\nThe staff at Gili treat you like royalty. Nashid, Roberto, Shayan, Samu and Nakul enhanced my dining experiences with their warm and welcoming manner and attention to detail. Serene, my Miss Friday, was amazing. As I was travelling on my own, she happily obliged my numerous requests for photo shoots (Sorry, Serene!) She arranged a trip for me to see the Private Reserve and also managed to source some deodorant from Male for me, when i realised that i had left mine on the plane! But the one thing I will remember the most is the beach decoration for my birthday and the dinner that followed. I had seen pictures on Instagram of decorations on the beach and asked Serene if i could have something similar but with a star. When i arrived to dinner on the beach, i was speechless! Serene, Samu and the team had gone above and beyond to create something special for me. During my dinner some of the team came to sing happy birthday to me, including the resort manager, which made me feel special again! Then when i returned to my villa, Serene had decorated it for my birthday and i had a cake waiting for me, wishing me a happy 20, 20th birthday which made me laugh! This was a joke that i had shared with a few staff members about not wanting to be 40, but 20 20 instead. It was incredible that the staff had remembered this joke, especially when they are interacting with many guests, and used it to enhance my Gili experience.\r\nWhen the time came to leave, i was holding back the tears. Just before i got on the speedboat, i had my photo taken with Serene. All guests have a photo taken with their Friday and this is framed - a lovely momento! Then i bid Gili farewell.\r\nI'd like to thank everyone at Gili who made my Gili story so memorable. I will definitely return when the resort re-opens and hopefully throw my passport into the ocean this time, so i wont have to leave!","text":"I stayed at Gili Lankanfushi for 3 days to celebrate my 40th birthday.

Scuba diving was another thing that has spoiled us of diving with anyone else. From the moment we got on the boat, we didn\u2019t have to do a thing. They took care of preparing all of our gear. They lead us to the top deck of the boat to relax, giving us drinks and fruit. When it was time to get in the water, our gear was ready and they helped us put it on and assisted us until we were in the water. In the water, our guide didn\u2019t stop the top notch service. I was so amazed with the coral and sea life that I was consumed with taking pictures. Our guide was so helpful with this that he went as far as pulling me along the reef so that I could get the best pictures. Talk about service!

Everything was exceedingly well done and we felt truly relaxed after our stay.\r\n\r\nThe Room:\r\nWe stayed in the Crusoe Villa near the Bar Bara and it was great. The simplicity of the villa with its beautiful design was truly breathtaking. I especially liked all the wooden features that were all around in the room, it shows how they strive to achieve sustainability and eco-friendliness. We could tell there was an immense attention to detail.\r\n\r\nThe Island:\r\nOur villa was surrounded by jungle and it felt extremely peaceful to walk around the sandy paths while barefoot. The banyan trees were also stunning. The two methods of transportation on the island are Bike and Electric Buggy. While staying on the island you don\u2019t see all too many people (except while dining) so the resort feels very exclusive. You are also able to do some great snorkeling right off the beach in front of your villa, as their house reef is exceptionally beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe Dining:\r\nEvery single restaurant at the resort has exceptional food. Ranging from Maldivian to Mediterranean food options there is no way that you will not find something you love. The chefs cook very precisely, again with attention to detail, and are also very efficient. The venues of the restaurants were also breathtakingly beautiful (our personal favorite was the \u201cfresh in the garden\u201d as it was quite the experience to dine above the treetops). We even got to experience the truly amazing 3 star Michelin French chef that was at the resort at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Staff:\r\nThe people that work at this resort are also great. They\u2019re all extremely friendly, helpful and attentive. They also feel very genuine and seem to do their work passionately and with love. I would like to especially praise our Mr. Friday Micky that helped us in every way possible and made our stay delightful. My children also were also delighted to get to play some ping-pong with another Mr. Friday, Shan. He was a great, genuine guy and my kids really enjoyed it. The marine biologist, Elina, who noticed our great interest in wildlife, kept nourishing our interests and answered every question we could possibly ask her.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, visiting Soneva Fushi was a once in a lifetime experience that I would recommend to everyone.","text":"My Family and I stayed at Soneva Fushi in October 2019 and we had an absolutely phenomenal time.

Rooms are nice, offered free snorkeling tour everyday and shouldn't missed. We had Romantic beach dinner one night with lobster and champagne, so good as well as service! There is one thing to say, we cancelled Wakeboarding but reception and water sports desk didn't have good communication and they charged for it. We had a bit of argument but at last, they deducted the price for wakeboarding. We also went for Dolphin Watch but couldn't meet them. Well, this is not their fault, then they refund half price.\r\nMost of people stays in Maldives at least a week, thinking of having not good food for a week is not cool.

From the incredible views and sunsets, which just got better by day, the amazingly kind and friendly staff and the incredible food, I have to say it was hard to leave! The excursions were awesome and I would highly recommend the dolphin watching. The only slight negative was the roofs of the rooms during rain, extremely loud and did wake us up a couple of times but I\u2019m sure as soon the island is redone this issue will be changed. The sea plane was amazing.. because the island is so far from Male you really get to embrace those views. When you get there you are assigned a waiter for the duration of your stay. We we lucky to have Saleem. He was brilliant and treats you as though you are the only people there. Always remembered our favourite drinks and I\u2019ve never met someone so smiley. The man who makes the naan bread also needs a special mention as it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve ever had!

We would go back with pleasure.\r\n\r\nScuba diving: 5\/5\r\nStaff was extremely friendly (thanks to Stephane and Philippe) who went the extra mile to help.\r\nDive sites are mostly within 0-50 min boat ride. Saw many white tip reef sharks, grey reef sharks, black tip reef sharks, turtles, octopus, eels, shrimps, lobsters and many Mantas!! At manta point they were with us for 60min at the cleaning station simply majestic.\r\nFYI the morning boat leaves at 0800 and returns between 1230-1300 whereas breakfast starts at 0730 and lunch is from 1230-2000. This means you do end up rushing to make it... but that is usually the case when diving.\r\n\r\nSnorkelling: 4\/5\r\nVery good. I give 4\/5 as opposed to 5\/5 due to coral which unfortunately suffered like most inner reefs in 2016 (significantly dead\/ damaged)... nevertheless, we went snorkelling every days for 1-3 hrs after diving and always saw something cool, eg turtles, sharks, many many fish, octopus. A big advantage compared to other islands we have been to is you can snorkel around the island without being concerned by too strong currents (start at the peer by the bar).\r\n\r\nIsland: 5\/5 very nice island, beach bungalows are discreet and give it a natural feel as they are not visible from boats. There is lots of vegetation. Also, bring Mosquito repellent.\r\n\r\nStaff: 5\/5 very friendly overall. Great service at the bar, at the restaurant and the reception. Room was cleaned and beds made every day, gardening staff also friendly. One waiter at the bar was not very friendly but we rarely had him so it was not an issue.\r\n\r\nFood: 5\/5 considering this is a 3 star hotel\r\n- Bar food is good, we had the tuna or club sandwich and were happy. The fries were very good.\r\n- restaurant: menu changes every night, the grill fish was very good but also unexpected western meals such as lasagna.\r\n- do not expect high end cuisine but more tasty curry, pasta, vegetables.\r\n\r\nAccommodation: 4\/5. Quite good for a 3 star. We stayed in Room 136 which we were very happy with (see pictures).\r\n\r\nTransfers: 5\/5 we were upgraded to the seaplane from the Boat for free which took 25mim (Boat takes 1.5-2 hrs we were told).

The water villa we stayed in provided us with the privacy we wanted. The all-inclusive was well worth it as the villa was restocked every single day. We enjoyed dinner at The Jing restaurant and bar as it had an elegant city bar feel to it but with the beautiful view of the sea. We also enjoyed dinner at Meeru. We thought that it would be an ordinary outdoor grilled dinner experience but we were proven wrong as we were presented with excellent fine-dining options paired with wine. It was a perfect night because of the perfect ambience and food. We also liked the fact that we had to dress up a bit, and so it felt like we were on a date. When we requested to see their wine collection, we were warmly welcomed into the wine cellar and saw how well-stocked they were. They had 3 sommeliers on the resort at that time who were extremely helpful when we were choosing our wine to pair with our food. Special thanks to Satia and Manish who were very accommodating and shared so much of their knowledge with us.\r\nThe heart of a place is always its people and we can definitely say that Constance Halaveli is full of heart. There were a couple of snags that we noticed and shared with them during our stay. They immediately took notice and fixed it right away. We commend each and every employee of Constance Halaveli as each one was professional yet extremely warm and pleasant. They made us feel valued during our stay. We also really liked how they were always on their toes to make us feel at home. Their staff were like little elves (like in the elves and the shoemaker). Every time, we would come back to our villa after eating breakfast and after exploring the island, we\u2019d find our Villa already cleaned and organized. Their staff worked seamlessly and invisibly. We also like the fact that they respected our privacy and that the staff made sure that all our needs and requests were met. They were very intuitive in catering to our needs and we loved every minute of our stay there. Special thanks to the following people who made our stay memorable:\r\nAblo - for personally taking over our booking reservation and warmly welcoming us when we arrived on the island together with Dilya who gave us a quick tour of the island and welcomed us to our beautiful villa with a picturesque view. We also appreciate the effort in making my birthday vacation extra special with a delicious cake and excellent wine.\r\nShuhad - for being well-versed and thorough in informing us of our options. He warmly and professionally explained many things to us.\r\nSatia and Manish - for being accommodating and informative. We enjoyed learning about your wines and would love to come back to learn more.\r\nSaji - for being caring and intuitive in meeting our expectations.\r\nShameer, Nasaril, Rochelle - for being attentive, friendly, respectful and professional. Thank you for making our eating experience extra memorable with your smiles and your attention.\r\nTo all other staff who were intuitively catering to our every need even without asking, we thank you!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we are in awe at how we were treated by your staff. We frequent other island resorts and we have come to the conclusion that Constance Halaveli has so far made it to the top of our list. We will be back.","text":"We had no doubt that our stay in Constance Halaveli was going to be picture perfect. The water villa we stayed in provided us with the privacy we wanted.

I still wonder how they could find so much nice and qualified persons... I really have to thank Patrice, the general manager for his talent, he made us feel like royalties, each and every days! I also want to say a special thanks to Kartik for his delicious Cocktails and funny stories, to Som who made his best every morning to answer my hard to please fruit requests, Saprota who makes the best eggs Benedict and who has a smile that makes you feel good for the whole day, Hassan at the \"fine dining\", Suka and Peter at the Vibes bar lunch, and finally the lovely Oana, always fresh for the morning Yoga, under the coconuts trees.\r\nYou guys are the spirit of this paradise and you make it UNIQUE.

We were spoilt with sunset cruises with canap\u00e9s and sparkling wine, trips to nearby reefs with guided snorkelling, daily yoga, romantic candlelight dinners, 80 wines from around the world and champagne all day long, incredible food from several different restaurants on site and staff that go out of their way to ensure the guests feel at home. One of the chefs found out I was Filipino and even prepared a special Filipino dish for me and my wife in one of our lunches. Nothing is too much for them.\r\n\r\nI did three dives at their dive Center and the staff there were extremely professional and friendly. Laura in particular I thought was an excellent dive instructors and helped point out numerous hawksbill turtles, sharks, rays, nudi branches, octopuses and several other species when I dove with them. My wife who doesn\u2019t have a dive license snorkelled around the island, and the marine life around the island is just as impressive. She also saw several grey and white tip sharks, a turtle and rays while snorkelling, amongst uncountable other fish. Definitely a fantastic house reef. I will say that the corals have suffered and are still recovering from the coral bleaching 10 years ago - but this is apparently the case all throughout Maldives. All in all, it was still excellent.\r\n\r\nWe wish we could have stayed longer at the resort and hope we can come back.

I have never been to another Maldives island so cannot compare it to others. I have always chosen the beach bungalow as that is true Maldives Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nAccommodation: very spacious and clean. A bit tired but in my opinion in need of some colour. It's the tropics and I love the lush green. The walls could reflect the amazing sea life. Leave the trendy bright white to the sea villas.\r\n\r\nFood: very good but a bit repeative but it's a tiny island and quality and cooking very high standard.\r\n\r\nStaff: fantastic, genuinely friendly and always ready to hear what you had done that day or had planned.\r\n\r\nActivities: apart from relaxing its sea based, the coral has lost its colour and there is definitely fewer fish. However we had 8 sightings of turtles, 2 so up close one bumped my snorkel mask and another followed our kayak popping up beside us. Dolphins both out at sea and off shore, eagle and manta ray, many little and one big shark. Night snorkelling highly recommended.\r\n\r\nThe down side: smoking, only place to get away from it is own accommodation, sitting at the bar and restaurant. Coming from UK where smoking is limited to specified areas were found this difficult. We wanted to sit and enjoy pre and post dinner drinks, or sit in reception area to use the Internet. We moved several times and it was off putting. Desperately need no smoking areas.\r\n\r\nInternet: if it can be in water villas why not bungalows.\r\n\r\nReception area: no sole I remember it being so welcoming, warm with a big table with large bowl of fruit and flowers. It's the board game and seating very comfortable but again no colour, don't try and be The White Company.\r\n\r\nPrior to arriving I told my husband (this was his first visit) that the minute you step foot on the pontoon you are made to feel welcome. The manager and staff are their waiting for you, a VIP welcome. It didn't happen. We were met by a member of staff who was very polite took us to the soulless reception, quick drink with usual cold towel then off to our bungalow. During the 11 days we were there we got the odd nod of head from the manager. It's a small island not a huge number of guest. We saw him once when he met up with his wife on the night snorkelling when we returned, by the bar in the evening. I did give honest feed back prior to leaving and I questioned if the bungalow guests are seen as the \"economy section\"\r\n\r\nDrone: what a shock when I saw a drone being flown. I questioned this with a staff member who told me they are allowed but sign an agreement not to publish images. Point missed, don't allow them. I asked the young man flying it remove it from the vicinity of our bungalow as I was enjoying a peaceful afternoon and all I could hear was the high pitched buzz, very intrusive.\r\n\r\nI have always highly recommended this island but I was left a bit flat after this visit. It's so beautiful, staff are lovel, food great. Would we go back? My husband says yes but I'm not so sure.","text":"This was my 3rd visit, 1st 22 years ago, 2nd 5 years ago.

It was a best family vacation for us. We put a lots efforts to make this family reunion happened due to all family members in different places (America, Australia and Viet Nam). We were wondering, it might be too boring to stay in 1 island for 4 nights but actually not, it turned out not enough. We had so much fun and great experiences.\r\n\r\nWe were very enjoy our stays. We enjoyed watching sunrise and sunset with easy access to the beach from the back door. A resort had beautiful house reef with variety of fishes and corals. Most of coral are dead due to climate change that made ocean heat wave worse but thanks to Inga and marine biologist team are trying their best to recovery and reproductive a corals. Diamonds Athuruga is one of best house reef resorts and with all inclusive option so you can enjoy your stays without other expenses except some excursions.\r\n\r\nA services was great and very friendly. The buffet was ok to me due to not much option. Every breakfast was the same, lunch not much different and dinner changed daily with different cuisine. But with a services, room quality and natural house reef they had, it already satisfied us.\r\n\r\nBy the way, a resort also provided some FREE watersports activities: snorkeling tour (2 sessions per day), kayaking and sunset yoga.\r\nThere are a few excursions package with FEE such as Anemone Snorkeling\/ Sand bank, Manta Safari, Sunset Fishing, ..... and also private Dhoni (recommended) up to 4 hours so you can discuss a destination that you interested. We was lucky to have Hussain as our tour guide for our private Dhoni. He was knowledgeable of the Maldives and enthusiastically, he brought us to the most beautiful places to snorkel and very professional assist us when we need help.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a room booking, please book excursions as much as you can at a time of reservations. You will saving some costs.\r\n\r\nAnemone Snorkeling\/ Sand bank: it was beautiful white sand bank at middle of ocean with 45 mins boat ride. It will be the best time to visit it at low tide so you can see a bigger and longer walkway. When we been there at high tide (due to bad weather), we only able to see small sand bank exposed on top of water. But it was still good experience to visit. Then we heading to Anemone Coral Garden middle of ocean to do snorkeling. OMG, it was amazing colorful variety of fishes, corals and turtles.\r\n\r\nAfter a sand bank tour, we enjoyed so much so we booked last minute Dhoni Private Boat to explore more islands. We chose to focus on snorkeling to see more beautiful natures, fishes and corals. We also experienced to see Manta Ray.\r\n\r\nAlso thank you so much to Krzys General Manager with very warm welcome and came around chatting to make sure we was happy with our stayed.\r\n\r\nThank you all to Athuruga team from receptionist, restaurant staffs\/chefs, bar, housekeeping and excursion team for yours professional and friendly services. We hope we will have a chance to come back.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.","text":"We had 4 nights at Diamonds Athuruga for 5 adults, 2 Beach Junior Suite. It was a best family vacation for us.

The booking was made through Kuoni as a surprise celebration, the only thing my wife knew was we were off to paradise in the dream destination of the Maldives. I have to say Kuoni were fantastic throughout, the customer service was unbelievable. I picked to fly with Emirates via Dubai, and then Emirates to Mal\u00e9. I kept in regular contact with Kuoni who conveyed my ideas for my wife\u2019s 50th celebration to the team at Diamonds Athuruga, the customer service was out of this world leading up to departure. We flew from Heathrow and arrived in Mal\u00e9, we were meet by a Kuoni representative and guided to the TMA check-in. Our breath was immediately taken away by the clear blue colour of the sea. we travelled by sea plane to Athuruga which was the first moment my wife had seen the Beautiful setting I had chosen for the occasion, the reality of seeing the beautiful setting and Water Villa\u2019s blew even my expectations. We were greeted by the team lead by Francesca, the sea plane was greeted by boat. We were taken into the beautiful Diamonds Athuruga island, we were then taken by buggy to our water villa. Well what can I say, it was simply stunning. I love the villa\u2019s, the white structures set against the clear blue sea was breath taking. I certainly chose the style of accommodation over others, which suited our taste. We were settled into our villa and then we went off for lunch on the over water restaurant, our waiter was Solah who made our stay an amazing experience. His attention to detail was impressive, we only had to mention small details in passing which would make our stay even more memorable and we would find them put in place for us. We often returned to our Villa to find the staff\u2019s attention to detail had materialised into actions, we requested low sugar drinks for the mini bar and milk for extra cups of tea in the morning and without delay the requests were put in place. The customer service and attention to detail continued to remain at very high standards, one morning I lost my wedding ring in the sea. Our neighbours at Villa 10 came out and snorkelled around, to my amazing and relief found it on the bottom. When the team initially heard the concern to recover me ring was something I will never forget, and the action was lead by Solah after breakfast and even the diving team were mentioned to come and help. When ever we left the villa we were greeted by buggy, our driver had a interest in making our stay as memorable as possible. He would point out any Eagle-rays or Stingrays or Sharks, he would also bring our breakfast to our room with a welcoming smile. Our room attendant was Eesa, he kept our villa presented at a high standard throughout our stay. Our bed was made with a romantic theme upon our arrival, and on the day of my wife\u2019s birthday the bed was dressed in a birthday theme whilst we were at dinner. At dinner the team at the over water restaurant brought out a beautiful birthday cake and sang happy birthday, all arranged by the Diamonds team and Kunoi. We then went down to the island for a traditional Maldives evening, the team managed to get my wife up and dancing which she was always remember. We general eat in the over water restaurant, we did eat in the restaurant on the island and the food again impressive. We used both bars in the evenings, weather permitting we enjoyed evenings at the over water restaurant. We tried to mix up things up with evening drinks on the island, then head back to the villa to see out the evening before bed. We were provided with snorkelling equipment, I unfortunately picked up an ear issue after a few days where I had been swimming. I visited the island doctor to treat the eat infection, my experience who was very positive one. I had regular calls from Kuoni during our stay, special thanks to Amanda who could not do enough too make our experience a memorable one. We did not do any diving whilst on the island, we did one day excursion to see Dolphins and the sand bank. The Dolphins was something my wife wished for, the team from Athuruga did not let us down. The whole experience totally blew our minds, I will certainly be back in two years time for my 50th birthday (fingers crossed). The customer service was unbelievable, we really could not fault the experience and the levels and details the staff go to to make the stay a memory that will last for ever. The island is beautiful and the views are stunning, the weather was generally extremely good to us and we only had a few rainy days.","text":"I booked seven nights at Diamonds Athuruga for my wife\u2019s 50th birthday, we stayed in Water Villa 11.

I surprised my wife with an overnight stay on Lonubo and it was incredible! All of the staff kept it a secret. A breath taking little island, all to ourselves for the night with a lovely beach villa with jacuzzi.

The island has a real Robinson Crusoe feel to it and during our 7 day stay there were times that we felt like we were the only people on the island. What really makes this island so special though are the staff. They have a genuine desire to ensure that you have the best holiday possible. The other outstanding feature is the food especially the desserts, which are put together each day by a team of chefs who are quite simply outstanding. As has been mentioned on other reviews the stand out dessert is the Mexican Hot Chocolate Pudding. When we told the pastry chef how much we enjoyed it he made it especially for us and the team very kindly typed out the recipe for us before we left. The waiting staff not only make time to talk you but are also very talented when it comes to using the leaves from the island palm trees to make all sorts of animals. On our last night they prepared a table for us that had a beautiful floral table decoration and the napkins were folded to look like a waistcoat. They also presented us with a bird, fish and cricket that were all made out of palm leaves, just amazing and an unbelievably kind thing to do.\r\nWe stayed in beach villa 126, which like the other beach villas has a small path from the sun deck that leads through the trees and flowers out onto the beach where there were a number of sun beds set up for anyone to use.\r\nAlthough all of the staff were amazing we would like to especially thank Alamach, Munsif and Ismail who looked after us in the buffet and during our speciality wedding anniversary meal, as well as the free diving waiter who unfortunately we forgot to get his name. Samanth the incredible pastry chef, Yiranga the bbq chef and Dianask his colleague.\r\nAs has been mentioned by others although the villas are large they and some of the other areas of the island could benefit from some updating in particular the beds, which although they were large are not that comfortable. Hopefully this will be looked at during the refurbishment work that is due to take place between now and December but not to the detriment of the wonderful Desert Island feel that Maafushivaru has.\r\nThank you everyone for giving us an unbelievable introduction to The Maldives.","text":"This was our first ever visit to The Maldives and what an amazing introduction Maafushivaru gave us to this incredibly beautiful part of the world.

What really makes this island so special though...","nickname":"Adrian W "},{"title":"Don't go changin'","date":"20190501","rating":"5","full_text":"We\u2019ve recently returned from a 14 night stay at Maafushivaru. This was our 6th visit to the Maldives, and our 6th island. We\u2019d originally booked Sandies Bathala, but the opening was delayed and Kuoni moved us to Maafushivaru. This is quite a long review, so I\u2019ve broken it down into sections so you can scroll directly to whatever topic you\u2019re most interested in.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL\r\nWe had quite a long wait at immigration this time around, the queues seemed to take forever. Last year there was a scan of all luggage before exiting arrivals, but this year its changed and only hand luggage is scanned for \u2018contraband\u2019 before you collect your main luggage from the carousel.\r\nWe were met by two helpful Kuoni chaps when we exited the arrivals area who whisked us off to the seaplane check in, and we were swiftly en route in the mini bus to the seaplane terminal. Having done this transfer a few times before I was quite prepared for a wait, but in under an hour we were called for our transfer flight.\r\n\r\nTRANSFER\r\nMaafushivaru has a lounge room at the seaplane terminal which it shares with its sister islands Kuramathi and Kandohlu, it is however in the older section of the building which now overlooks the building site, so there\u2019s very little to look at while you wait. They have free soft drinks, tea, coffee and there was a selection of breakfast style pastries and cakes. Sadly we had no time to sample them, just enough time for a quick change out of our travelling clothes in the bathroom area. And its airconditioned of course.\r\nThe seaplane transfer took around 30 mins, stopping on the way to drop some guests off at Diamonds Athugua. As the seaplane came into land (or should that be sea) we were treated to a spectacular view of both the main island and its little sister island Lonubo. The plane lands at a little floating pontoon and the island\u2019s Dhoni arrives a moment or two after to collect you.\r\n\r\nCHECK-IN\r\nMaafushivaru is a splendidly laid back, non-pretentious, authentic Maldivian resort. There are no staff with hastily wrapped sarongs over their shorts banging drums in a somewhat false welcome, just an extremely polite and efficient guest relations representative to escort you through to the check in area. After a cold towel and drink Marc checked us in, explained how the resort worked, ran through the map for orientation and (and this is a first for me!) explained about how to snorkel safely, how not to touch the corals and fish as well as not feeding them. After a bite of lunch, we were shown to our room, number 110.\r\n\r\nROOM\r\nI\u2019d asked for a room around this area as it had been recommended to me by a previous guest, and we were delighted with the location. The beach villas are big, the beds are huge and there is plenty of storage for your clothes as well as an out of the way cubby for you to store your luggage. There\u2019s the usual safe in the wardrobe, plenty of good quality hangers and along with it a full size iron and ironing board (needless to say they remained unused during our stay!). The room is also equipped with a TV, a DVD player (we didn\u2019t use it) which also doubles up as an ipod docking speaker thingy. Sadly though it has the old style connectors so we were unable to use it. There\u2019s a kettle, a Lavazza Blue pod espresso machine (pods provided in both regular and decaf) and a minibar stocked with soft drinks and a couple of beers; these are included on the all inclusive plan. Anything you use from the minibar or the tea and coffee supplies you make a note of and its replenished the next day.\r\nThe bathroom is partly outside and partly \u2018inside\u2019. I say partly \u2018inside\u2019 because whilst it has walls and a door to the outer part there are little windows which don\u2019t have glass in them. In the \u2018indoor\u2019 area there\u2019s a shower cubicle, two sinks and a toilet. In the outside area there\u2019s a second shower and a washing line.\r\nAll in all the room was pretty well equipped, I have only one real gripe and that was the bed. Whilst it was huge even by Maldivian resort standards, it was incredibly hard and we both found it very uncomfortable. There was a softer mattress topper on it, but to be honest it didn\u2019t make much difference.\r\nOpposite the bed there are patio doors leading the rear decking area which has a covered double day bed and two sunbeds; there\u2019s a tap to wash sand off your feet too (also one by the front door). You also have another two sunbeds on the beach along with a parasol for shade. Marc explained that none of the beach beds are numbered and strictly speaking they don\u2019t \u2018belong\u2019 to the villa they\u2019re opposite. Although we never found any random guests on ours! Each morning someone puts your cushions on your beach beds, puts up your parasol and leaves a beach towel on each bed. They also collect the towels at the end of the day and bring your cushions under cover in case of rain.\r\n\r\nBEACH\r\nThe beach was lovely, super soft sand gently shelving into the ocean. There are quite a few seawalls at this resort which I thought might look a bit ugly. I\u2019ll be honest, they\u2019re not the most attractive things, but in my opinion they\u2019re better than sandbags as they tend not to deteriorate and given enough time will be colonised by the ocean critters and fish. They\u2019ve cleverly disguised some of the seawalls by mounting walkways and jettys on them. In our location we had full afternoon sun and a great view of the sunset.\r\n\r\nSNORKELLING\r\nThe reef encircles the island like many and it is possible to snorkel the whole way around, if you have the time and the energy for it! On one side is fairly close to the island whilst on the other side its some distance away. If you\u2019re not confident being this far away from the island then stick to the area around the main jetty which is much closer, the snorkelling is good all the way around. There are several exit\/entry channels to the outer reef some are further apart than others, and I would highly recommend their use; as does the resort. There can be little clearance on the corals especially at low tide. One day my husband had to turn back as even in the entry channel there wasn\u2019t enough depth for him to get back in. This meant a longer swim around to the next channel.\r\nWe rated the snorkelling here as pretty good. There lots of fish to see, all the usual colourful reef varieties along with large numbers of needle fish, bat fish, Napoleon wrasse, sweetlips etc. We also encountered a porcupine stingray in the lagoon, a couple of eagle rays (on several occasions) at the drop off, regularly met the turtle at the drop off opposite the water sports centre, and there are quite a few sharks around both juvenile and fully grown \u2013 one I swear was pregnant, she had a very large belly!\r\nWhilst the corals have suffered the same tragic bleaching as almost everywhere in the Maldives, there are many smaller patches of corals (acropora I think) which are alive. They\u2019re dotted around here and there, some pink, some blue. There are also more patches of soft corals and some of these are actually quite big. Plenty of the type that the \u2018nemo\u2019 fish love to live with along with some of the almost fluorescent ones (I\u2019m sure they must glow in the dark!).\r\n\r\nFOOD\r\nOn the All Inclusive plan as we were, all food is served in the buffet restaurant for all meals. The selection is very good. There is a live cooking station which offers several eggs options for breakfast along with at least three different offerings for lunch and dinner, along with a wide selection of both hot and cold dishes. There\u2019s a different theme each night which seemed to be repeated on a 7 day cycle. There was always a pasta offering for lunch and dinner, at dinner there was always a sushi offering, and always a curry of some description. Stand our dishes for me were the sushi, the cold noodles (salad), the gorgonzola pasta and the veggie curry. There is often a warm chocolate pudding at lunchtimes which occasionally makes an appearance at dinner time \u2013 this, folks, is NOT to be missed!! It was the most fabulous chocolate sponge. Everything I ate was delicious. The chefs are always on hand keeping the foods topped up and fresh, they\u2019ll explain the offerings and even help serve you.\r\nThere is a coffee bar situated between reception and the restaurant where you can grab a pastry and a cuppa from 10am until lunchtime, and between 3-5pm they serve afternoon tea, so if you have a lie in and miss breakfast there\u2019s no need to go hungry.\r\nThe seating area is in two areas, the main section is in the same tiled area as the food, and just across the path is a smaller more rustic area on the deck looking out to the ocean. We chose to sit in the decked area, but you\u2019re free to choose any available table, there\u2019s no allocated tables or table sharing here. The guys do a splendid job of looking after you, clearing away plates and serving drinks. Special mention to both Babul and Munsif, although all the guys were great I\u2019m just lousy at making a note of their names!\r\nBeware the lunctime Heron who comes by to check out whatever you may have and see if he can steal it away! Keep your bread rolls safe guys, and don\u2019t leave your hats or sunglasses unguarded if you\u2019re on the front row tables \u2013 eek, that beak!\r\n\r\nBAR\r\nWithout exception all the guys in the bar gave exemplary service \u2013 I just wish I could remember their names to give them a mention\u2026. They remembered our usual drinks, and were always at hand to top us up with fresh ones. I highly recommend the Negronis.\r\n\r\nLONUBO\r\nOne of Maafushivaru\u2019s USPs is its little sister island Lonubo. From our bit of beach we could look across to it. You can take the boat across three times a day at no charge; 09:30, 11:00 & 15:00. There are beach towels (on the arrival jetty), sunbeds and parasols along with a couple of toilets and a beach shower, but you need to take everything else you may need with you along with some drinks. Most people tend to take either the 09:30 or 15:00 boat so they are around for lunch. However we decided to forgoe lunch and have a larger breakfast and take the 11am crossing in the hope that we might get the island to ourselves until 3pm. We did! We had the whole place to ourselves, it was completely wonderful. The sand on Lonubo is even softer than on Maaf., the snorkelling is different, but equally good, there is however a bit more a current around this island and again the reef is a long way out in places.\r\nThe boat collected us a 3pm, and after a quick shower and change were wandered around to the coffee shop for afternoon tea and a cuppa and snack to take us through to dinner. Utterly perfect!\r\nIt is possible to take a picnic across, at additional cost, as well as have your evening meal there or even stay the night. There is a very well equipped villa on the island.\r\n\r\nAMBIENCE\r\nWe loved Maafushivaru, it\u2019s a total gem!\r\nIt\u2019s a proper old school, no shoes no news Maldivian island with lush planting, good villas and great staff and food. There really is nothing to dislike. The island is tiny, you can walk all the way around the circumference in about 5 mins. Its one of the few islands I\u2019d happily repeat.\r\nIf I were to be super critical, you can see that it\u2019s a bit tired in places. The tiles in the bathroom are showing their age, the linens and curtains are a little frayed here and there. All the tech in the room is a bit old, although it all still works well. The glasses are a bit of a mixed range. But for us that\u2019s all not only forgivable but actually adds the feel of the place, it gives it soul and a sense of permanence. There are so many new resorts these days all trying to out-do one another and offer something new or different. They lose sight of what most of us go to the Maldives for, relaxation, peace, to let all the stresses of the daily grind melt away. Maafushivaru will do all of that for you and more.\r\nThe island will close within a month or two for a refurbishment, I genuinely hope they don\u2019t change too much. Maybe some new curtains and towels, patch up a few thatched roofs, definitely change the mattresses PLEASE! Oh and if you could change the cutlery too, we really didn\u2019t like it ;-)\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to come back one day, Maafushivaru you made my repeat list, it\u2019s a very exclusive list! Thank you for such a wonderful time, thank you for all the delicious food and thank you to all the great staff that made our stay so magical \u2013 don\u2019t go changin\u2019 (too much).","text":"We\u2019ve recently returned from a 14 night stay at Maafushivaru.

We\u2019ve visited four different Maldivian islands and our favourite things about this island were; the beach villa was big and comfortable with good air conditioning, the sea life around the house reef was good and varied with lots of fish, some turtles and sharks, the all inclusive drinks were the best we\u2019ve ever had with so many different cocktails and premium brand spirits, variety of food was good and they are open to requests too, the dive shop is well run and weekly trips to the manta rays cleaning station which took around an hour were great, all the staff were always helpful and friendly, I only got one mosquito bite - which is a miracle for me (so their weekly fogging must be working). Unfortunately, like many islands, the coral is quite bleached around the island but there is still plenty of fish life. We had hoped to see whale sharks but missed out although we heard that two were seen on one of the snorkelling trips. In the rooms you can use English three pin plugs without adapters and it\u2019s quite a good idea to take a hairdryer if you want a cooler environment than the open air bathroom to dry your hair.

We stayed in a Deluxe water villa. Lat time we stayed in a Thundi villa. The room is identical but the Deluxe water villa does not have a pool. Was happy with that as we never really used the pool the last time, although it looked really nice.\r\n\r\nThe food was once again first class. If I returned I would not bother dining in the Duniye, We asked for steak & being Scottish, we generally like it towards the well done. They said they could not do that, as stated on the menu as it might be a bit chewy. If there is one thing we know about in the Aberdeen area (Aberdeen Angus) & that is our steaks. A good steak is still tender even if well done. Myself & my wife changed our selection. My wife had the lamb (Bultarra saltbush lamb 3 way) & to say it was pretentious is an understatement. The portion size was unbelievably small, while good it was the type of dish you would receive in a British pretentious restaurant at an exorbitant price. Now, I must say that is the only gripe on this holiday & no big deal & when we return we will just give this restaurant a miss.\r\n\r\nThe service in all the restaurants & bars was once again first class. We were allocated the Farivalhu restaurant as our main restaurant where we ate breakfast & the occasional lunch. The only way to go to Kuramathi is Select All Inclusive which meant we good eat in any restaurant at night & choose a different one at lunch. It would cost a lot of money to eat at the other restaurants if you were not Select All Inclusive.\r\n\r\nWould like to make a special mention to the following staff in the Farivalhu restaurant. They made our holiday especially memorable & we enjoyed talking to them about where they lived & their life in general. So interesting. Sam, Mussab, Nafiu, Ester (Star) also Joyce in the Inguru restaurant. The girls in the champagne bar were truly lovely, Anisa & Chara.\r\n\r\nI must make a special mention to Fayaz, our room boy. He kept the room so clean & tidy every day.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived on the Island I was delighted to see that the band Antedote are still there from our visit 2 years ago. They are absolutely fantastic & make sure you have a special song to request. You will not be dissapointed. They have changed the make up of the band & there are now 2 girls who are superb\r\n\r\nThe island Grill, Coffee Shop & Indian restaurant are very well run & was delighted to see the manager again who makes sure he speaks to all his guests.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to returning to Kuramathi some time in the next few years.","text":"This is our 2nd visit to Kuramathi & once again we were not disappointed.

Snorkeling fantastic, we were lucky enough to see a ray, sharks and turtles and I am not a confident swimmer, just hang on the role at the jetty and you won't miss anything.\r\nBeach bungalow was superb, we preffered them to the water bungalows and loved the outside shower.

Finally, we did! We were worried to see that the facilities had grown to include more accommodation, bars and restaurants. We felt that may make the previously secluded and idyllic island feel crowded. We didn't need to worry; the new additions were carefully planned and hidden so the atmosphere was not affected.\r\nWe got a 2 bedroom family 'room', which was essentially a small house. Set over two floors, with two large bathrooms and two outdoor showers, it was a world apart from our previous family holidays where we shared a room with the kids. It was spacious, modern and clean. The food is superb and I strongly recommend sampling the extensive cocktail menu (most of which is included in the all inclusive). The island was safe enough that we didn't worry if the kids wanted to go off snorkelling while we lazed in the sun. There is a kids club that we never used. We actually found it a positive that there weren't other children of a similar age to ours; they miraculously got on better than they have in a long time. In fact, our Kuramathi kids were much more pleasant than our Home kids!\r\nIt's a very long journey for us, and yes it is expensive - but it's the type of trip every family should try to do at least once.

There is a packed minibar included in the all inclusive price with wine and soft drinks and glass bottled water. A handy coffee\/tea machine is there and pods are provided. The decor is minimalistic and white, creating a perfect contrast with the blue of the sea. Toiletries provided are eco-safe, in refillable glass bottles and natural ingredients. The water villas have an iMac in the room loaded with movies and music to use and connected to internet. A beautiful wooden deck is attached with dining table & chairs, sofas and sun loungers and to top it off a wonderful jacuzzi. Every morning you can enjoy your breakfast on the deck, brought to you by the lovely waiters from the Over Water restaurant. Saeed, our room assistant, kept the room spotlessly clean every day, creatively making beautiful bed decorations each morning which we enjoyed very much, thank you Saeed!\r\nThe sea is infinite shades of blue & turquoise full of beautiful coral and sea-life, perfect for those who are passionate about snorkeling like us. The resort has a resident marine biologist, Leoni, who gave us the amazing opportunity of creating a coral frame to help regenerate the reef around the island. we worked with her to attach coral fragments to the frame and then helped to drop it in the sea to grow. A lovely way of giving something back to the sea. We can't wait to see the email updates showing it's progress :) All of the water sports team are so helpful and friendly too. Irina, thank you for your helpfulness and kindness.\r\nWe had our meals at the Over Water restaurant. The food was delicious. The kitchen provided for my gluten & dairy intolerances with ease and creativity. Thank you to chef Thusitha for your kindness! The team of waiters are all amazing.

Thanks also to Mauween, Husham and Anil, you are all so kind.\r\nTo get to and from the water villas to the main island there is a buggy that you can call for, useful during peak sun hours when the ealkway can get pretty hot! A special thanks to the buggy boys Levan & Sayfulla who we loved to chat to during the ride.\r\nWe had some fabulous massages at the Serena Spa on the island. The two ladies (whose names I cannot remember, sorry) were amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the treatments.\r\nTabitha & Simone at the front desk, are always willing to help regarding any requests.

The sand is like powder by far the softest sand I\u2019ve ever felt. On the deck there was a table and chairs as well as two comfier chairs and small coffee table. On the beach in front there were 2 sun loungers a small table and parasol.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is amazing!! Warm not too wavy and so many fish! We saw a turtle within the first couple of days which was breath taking. No sharks but lots of fish. We loved that there was a chart near the dive centre about what fish you may say so we could work out what we had seen. Titan Trigger fish bit scary!\r\n\r\nHUGE fruit bats I loved watching them all day and night.\r\n\r\nWe unfortunately had to make use of the on site doctor twice (I was badly bitten by a spider and hubby had an eye infection) he was polite helpful friendly and really good sorted us both out really quickly and avoided a disaster. We didn\u2019t have to pay as it was included in our price. Thank you so much to him!\r\n\r\nThe food was incredible! We ate at the buffet every meal and were not disappointed. Breakfast we often had omelette and fruit which set us up for a day of relaxation! We booked our candle lit dinner on the beach as well.\r\nEvery dinner was amazing the freshly grilled fish, the dhal (amazing!!!!) the curries the salad, everything I can\u2019t speak highly enough. My husband tried jack fish, rainbow fish, barracuda so many different sorts I had tuna which was to die for. I hate dhal at curry houses in the uk but here it was beautiful.\r\nThe candle lit meal was such a beautiful touch Zareer our regular waiter also waited on us that evening again food and drink to die for.\r\n\r\nMaldivian night was so much fun!! The food again spectacular and lovely eating outside under the palm trees and stars.\r\n\r\nThe wines are amazing I\u2019m not a wine drinker normally but so good!\r\n\r\nDuring the day we would swim often and most days go for a walk around the island stopping at the beach bar for a drink or 2 and a snack!\r\n\r\nThe dive centre were so helpful with their advice.\r\n\r\nShisha is a lovely touch in the evenings $15 and worth every penny!\r\n\r\nOur waiter Zareer was the kindest man ever! I can\u2019t speak highly enough of him. I was truly sad to leave him he is an asset to diamonds.\r\nKhalil was a waiter at the bar he is a legend totally amazing! Again so kind and helpful another huge asset.\r\n\r\nI want to come back so much! Already saving and planning! Thank you diamonds for making out honeymoon out of this world!

The bed was huge, the A\/C in the room was very efficient and managed to keep a nice a cool temperature in the room.\r\nAll other resort facilities where also kept tidy, having a very specific Island \u201ctheme\u201d that made you feel very well.\r\n\r\nHotel staff and service\r\nThis is where Gangehi really wins their guests. I will ran out of adjectives to describe how warm, friendly and welcome everyone has been. Every single staff member always wears a smile on their face and make you feel like royalty.\r\nSpecial thanks to Venka, Raja, Seelam (I hope I got the name right), our room boy and Karma at the SPA.\r\n\r\nFood and drinks\r\nThe resort offers mostly typical European cuisine and if you are picky you might find it a bit boring after a couple of days. We however tried to eat smart, not to taste everything on the first day and really managed to get our \u201crotation\u201d right.\r\nThe in-resort Thari restaurant serves very good drinks and the food there (we tried once the Lobster and Beef stir fry) is tasty and nicely served.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nThe resort offered a wide range of in and off Island activities for guests. Paid excursions to nearby reefs, diving activities for certified divers, trips to nearby local Islands or to open Ocean in search of marine life. All those are supported by Italian born divers and marine biologist who are very friendly and on the spot to answer all questions.\r\nThe on the Island pass time can be spent on snorkeling in the reef surrounding the resort full of various marine wildlife (fish, sharks, stingrays, turtles, etc.), the resort also offered kayaks and surf boards free of charge.\r\nAlso two times per day an instructor led yoga sessions and a paid SPA with various treatments (my wife took one session with hot stones and was really satisfied).\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nTogether with my wife we started to plan our return to Gangehi already as it will always have a special place in our hearts. Thank you for a honeymoon to remember!\r\n\r\nSide note\r\nWe were part of a larger group of Polish tourists and a few of them displayed absolutely all the worse traits during their stay showing no respect to the hard working staff of Gangehi. I feel obliged to apologize for their behavior on behalf of all the other Polish tourists. Please don\u2019t think bad of us :) there are black sheep everywhere.","text":"We just recently concluded a week stay at the Gangehi Resort.

Our party has 2 kids and 2 adults. We stayed at the Ocean Villa with water slide.\r\n\r\nThe resort is situated close to Male Airport. It\u2019s a 30-40 mins speed boat ride. Upon arriving at the airport, you can check in at the resort lounge at the airport. There are only a few resorts which have a lounge. This saves a lot of check in time.\r\n\r\nThe resort arranged a luxurious yatch to transfer us from the airport to the resort. All bags were carried by resort staff. Upon arrival, we were greeted by resort staff.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the resort at about 1 PM. As our room was not ready until 3 PM, we were kindly offered a day room. We were taken to a resort tour on a golf cart.\r\n\r\nEach Villa has a butler. We are grateful to have Michelle assigned to us. She looked after us and my kids very closely.\r\n\r\nOur Villa has a magnificent view over the lagoon and the Indian Ocean. The Villa is huge. There is a King Sized Bed and two sofa beds. Outdoor- there is a slide, plunge pool, beach chairs with sand, 2 dining tables and a dymock. We can jump into the lagoon and snorkel there. The water is about 2 meters deep. The water is quite clean and warm. If it was not because of the monsoon season, the water will be much more cleaner and calm. We snorkeled basically everyday.\r\n\r\nThere are other types of villas like detached ocean villas with slide, ocean villa without slide and beach villa. There is of course the Royal Residence (US30K per night, private beach, private gym, private restaurant, 3 villas and an exclusive butler).\r\n\r\nWater center staff are very nice. My kid did Discover Scuba with Jane and it was a very good start for him.\r\n\r\nThere is a kids club with indoor and outdoor activities. There is also a pool. Staff are great and friendly.\r\n\r\nRestaurant staff are very nice generally. We felt very welcomed and many staff remembered our room number and our preferred drinks.\r\n\r\nThere are a few themed restaurants. French and Indian cuisine were great!\r\n\r\nThe spa was great! Therapist are very experienced. When I lie fat on the message bed, there is a glass flood to look into the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter all the above good things, there are a few things to improve:-\r\n\r\n1. Our room WiFi was dead during the first 2 days of our stay. While it was obvious that the router had problems, IT insisted to change the LAN cables and reset the router repeatedly. The problem was gone after IT agreed to replace the router after I insisted for 2 days. During that 2 days, Michelle had kindly lend me her data SIM card.\r\n2. Food is a bit pricey ... given the price of the resort.\r\n3. Food quality can improve by a lot. The food was like Mr Wong\u2019s buffet ....\r\n\r\nAfter all, it\u2019s a great experience and the resort is great!","text":"I stayed at this resort for 4 nights. Our party has 2 kids and 2 adults.

Where do I start?\r\nUpon arriving at Male airport, we were greeted by Lujuin who was the first sign that this was going to be a great. He helped us every step of the way to check in and he also helped us when we were leaving. There were massive lines but he somehow got us around the long lines directly into the airport.\r\nWhen we arrived to the island, everyone greeted us and gave us welcome drinks. We got a tour of the island and it was amazing. Notably, here are some of the people that made our trip memorable. Chunky, Sanjay, Trishna, Longsy, Nifras, Bennett and Jaylum.\r\nChunky... is an amazing person, he is the best photographer and just great company overall. He walked us through everything, booked all our dinners and checked on us every day.\r\nWe loved SIP which is a restaurant on the water with a great sunset view. This is where Sanjay, Nifras and Trishna work. They are the best mixologists on the island. Great and friendly people!\r\nLongsy is in charge of Kitchen and he is a really great person. He looked after us at every moment he could. My wife wasn\u2019t feeling well one night and when we got back to our bungalow, we had hot ginger tea and lemon waiting for her to help her get better.\r\nBennett is at whatever whenever and he was amazing. He helped us check in and check out and even gave us a parting gift!\r\nJaylum was our housekeeper. This was bittersweet. Jaylum did our room for the first two night then I think they switched persons. He was very OCD neat and he cleaned and organized everything for us. Folded all our throw clothes and organized our toiletry items. Unfortunately after the 2nd night, we noticed things weren\u2019t as clean and organized so we were bummed out. He was amazing!\r\nThis is where I will keep it real. This is a Honeymoon (relaxing and quality time) location. I was expecting the W to be a crazy party scene but it is quite the opposite. They allow small infants and children on the island and we unfortunately went when it was Chinese New Year so there were too many Chinese people. (I am mixed Chinese myself)\r\nSnorkeling is amazing, turtles, stingrays, nurse sharks, many fish were beautiful sites.\r\nThe SPA is top notch! Chimmy was amazing!\r\nI would definitely return one day in the future!\r\nCheers W! Thank you for the memorable honeymoon!","text":"We spent 2 weeks in Thailand and we spent 6 nights here at W Maldives to complete our honeymoon. Where do I start?\r\nUpon arriving at Male airport, we were greeted by Lujuin who was the first sign that this was going to be a great.

Here are the top 5 reasons to stay here:\r\n\r\n5. Helpfulness- I arrived on this trip a bit nervous about recovering from a badly broken foot. Not only did somebody like Azim or Thutuu help me in and out of the water each time but they also suggested I massage my foot with sand each day, and they helped do it.\r\n\r\nThe trip was made easy and I certainly heeled, quite a bit, for anybody who needs swimming as part of physical rehabilitation, not only will you find the help here-you will feel grateful you came. When I arrived I could not walk in or out of the ocean, without a lot of help, that was lovingly given. When I left 10 days later, I was able to walk on my own, and in a very real and tangible way, this was in part because of the folks at the W Maldives.\r\n\r\n4. The View- While I know this one is obvious and the reason we all go to the Maldives, to begin with, the views are better here, than the other 3 places we have been in the Maldives.\r\n\r\n3. Luxury- The rooms are beautifully appointed. The overwater bungalows have pools on the deck-talk about WOW. Every day we were surprised with a small treat in our room in the afternoon, from drinks to tasty bites.\r\n\r\n2. Service- Anuj the GM of the hotel came from the Ritz Carlton and it shows. I have stayed at Marriott hotels throughout the world; I can tell you the service here is the best I have ever seen here. I will go one step further. This hotel has the best service of any hotel I have ever stayed at, better than my stay at the world's nicest hotel, the Burj-Al-Arab. The staff lives to serve, they truly care about not just you as the guest, but you as a person, and it shows with how every detail is prepared and executed.\r\n\r\n1. The House Reef- The Reef is pristine and is one of the top 3 reefs I have ever seen and certainly the best ,near a hotel. Unfortunately, most of the reefs in the world are on the decline or dying; this reef was very healthy and alive. There is even a marine biologist on staff to makes sure that the reef stays that way. Every day we say sea turtles, small baby manta rays, small baby sharks, live and vibrant coral and millions of beautiful fish. If snorkeling is an important part of your vacation, this is literally the best hotel in the world to stay at.\r\n\r\nStaff: We wanted to do a special thank you to all the extraordinary staff, there were a few standouts:\r\n\r\nAnuj: Always making us feel like the hotel was truly ours. His staff also really admires him and it's hard not to\r\n\r\nChunky: For making us laugh near each day, for sharing ideas on how to make the most of our trip. Chunky doesn't know the word \"No.\"\r\n\r\nAzim: For taking us everywhere (Azim picked us up in a golf cart) including helping me walk into the water, while I was recovering from a broken foot\r\n\r\nThttu: for always trying to find more sharks and eagle rays for us to see and for making us laugh\r\n\r\nHarpal: For making it easy to be a vegetarian and for going above and beyond in every meal where I was on the island- I think you are a very integral part of the reason this hotel has better service than the Burj-Al-Arab.\r\n\r\nFaruk- For always bringing us custom smoothies and fruit each day during breakfast\r\n\r\nSanji-for all the wonderful drink and dinner suggestions and impeccable meal service\r\n\r\nMy wife and I want to thank the entire staff for one of the very best vacations we have ever had.","text":"We went to this beautiful hotel for our 8th Anniversary and were not disappointed at all.

We had the deluxe overwater bungalow with private pool.\r\nRooms: the rooms are gorgeous and very thoughtful. they have many small things in the rooms like slippers, torch, even binoculars to make it more comfortable. You can go directly into the sea from your room deck. At night, we had many sting rays which used to come to the bottom of our deck stairs so that was also very cool. The rooms are awesome and comfortable.\r\nFood:\r\ngreat food and good variety, but expensive like all things in maldives. Expect to spend USD 100-150 per meal per person for a 3 course meal. We had the full board but found it un-necessary since the dishes were large (for us) and we ended up sharing more often than not. Service is universally slow and it generally took 2 hours to complete a meal. The drinks are uber expensive with water being $7, beer $10-12, cocktails around $18-20. Breakfast spread is good but gets boring after a few days coz its the same thing everyday.\r\nSnorkelling\r\nits a pity that there is no good snorkelling around. The only passable patch we found was between the dhigu jetty and the mojo island. also decent around room 153-\r\nOverall staff was very courteous and helpful.\r\nI think its a wonderful resort to go to for a time when you want to be only by yourself (as a couple). i wouldn't really recommend it for children and snorkelling.

It is a good size and not stuffy at all. You are in the Maldives after all so it is hot and there is humidity.\r\n\r\nThe check in process we found was very personal and left us in no doubt about the facilities and what was included in our all inclusive package. Again I am not sure why some reviewers have complained. They also give you a brochure which goes through everything.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in an over water villa on the side by the quiet lap pool. The room is not palatial but was perfectly fine for what we wanted. You are not there to be in your room 24-7 and the fact you could step straight from your room down the ladder into the warmest water ever was spectacular. I also think the snorkelling was the best on our side of the island.\r\n\r\nThe new pool opened on the Monday we were there and is a great spot overlooking the main beach with great music and a swim up bar.\r\n\r\nYes there is a rubbish burning but it is miles away. You don\u2019t see it unless you are using the one pool or walking the boardwalk to our villas. I would have had to walk right to the edge of my balcony and peer right around the side of the partition to see it. It needs to be remembered the island is only 20 minutes from the mainland so of course you are going to see things other than ocean on that side of the island.\r\n\r\nStaff are amazing if you take the time to get to know them and treat them with the respect they deserve. They were all genuinely happy and couldn\u2019t do enough for us in the restaurants and bar areas.\r\n\r\nRestaurants are all great. I do not understand complaints about Oceans. I agree if I was vegetarian there could be some more variety but overall the food on offer is great. They do a different theme every day so you don\u2019t get bored. There are 3 other restaurants Thai, Italian and Middle Eastern. We ate at each of them twice in our 7 night stay. The hours for each restaurant are fixed but if you can\u2019t get there in the 3 hour window for each service then the problem is yours not theres.\r\n\r\nFlys well yes they are there and at the Viu bar they seem particularly bad some nights but we did not have a problem anywhere else on the island or at our Villa. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the Mainland being so close and is perhaps just that time of year.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban band that plays around the island is fantastic.\r\n\r\nWe had a great time and would return.","text":"This was our first trip to Maldives and we were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we left customs area we were greeted by a hotel representative who took us across the road to meet the boat.\r\nThe trip across is only 20 minutes and I do not understand why people are complaining about the boat.

All bar and restaurant options were awesome and well worth trying but La Brezza probably took out the prize although have to say buffet breakfast was amazing and at buffet lunch the Japanese pancake station a real hit!

It's kind of strange and a bit of uncertainty of the details beforehand. Example, we were informed to return by domestic flight (instead of seaplane) and aware only the night before we checked-out. Anyway, everything went well in the end and the coordination was entirely handled by resort staffs.\r\n\r\nRoom - We split our stays half each in beach villa & ocean villa. Both was very good. If you prefer more beach area, nice sand and nearer to action place\/restaurants, beach villa is a better option. If you like to watch the fish and sky directly from room, ocean villa is the superb place.\r\n\r\nStaffs - Most of them were amazing, very friendly and professional. They are the greatest asset of Centara resort. Special mentioned & appreciated very much to the help of Ms Lark from customer service & Adil from best dives team, who had genuinely been taking care for our needs with true passion.\r\n\r\nRecommendation - Cost of spa treatment & water activities to be improved.

Best to snorkel from Northern Jetty easterly around to the main Southern Jetty as sheltered from wind and reef is closer to shore. The drop off from the reef is deep and there is a lot of very big fish on the outside of the reef. A good choice of optional tours, including the Turtle Reef Snorkelling tour that we went on. It was a 40 minute boat ride to the Northern part of the atoll, but it was worth it, as we saw 10 sea turtles feeding on the reef and an amazing amount of fish varieties. We snorkelled for around 40 minutes and guide Hamdhan provided us with valuable insights and pointed out the various species of sea life, while snorkelling with us. Sister resort Angsana is located only a 5 minute free boat ride away and enables guests to enjoy that islands facilities, while charging any costs back to your room. The Banyan Tree Spa was wonderful and staff were well trained & very friendly. A great time had by my wife & I and we would love to return some time in the future.","text":"Resort only 30 minutes from Male airport by speedboat transfer.

The tour was arranged by TripADeal and it went without an issue. The Sri Lanka sector was full on which is as we like it and the subsquent stay at Adaaran was a nice way to wind down and relax. We had upgraded the entire tour accommodation with excursions, including the climb of Sigiria rock which is a must do. When a planned tour comes together without any hiccups, regardless of the locations and experiences then that deserves a commendation. But include a great tour guide and excellent excursions, then a five star is the award. It should be noted that we upgraded which resulted in excellent accommodation and a beach villa at the Maldives. Believe me it's worth the little extra. Some people on our tour did not and they were disappointed. You get what you pay for. But honestly the worse accommodation on this island is pretty special.\r\nAdaaran has that 'Island' feel and the facilities were great. The inclusive drinks package made it easy to budget and we did not enconter any abuse of that. Everyone was in a good mood and easy to speak with. The snorkling is first rate. I met my target of swimming with multiple large reef fish, turtles and the odd harmless reef shark and that was just out the front of the resort. Water quality, although overcasts most days, was great. The open buffet style of eating was excellent and allowed us to be fussy about what we eat. There was a good selection of western styled food, especially the barbequed lamb chops on two occassions, yum. We elected to pay for a beach dinner ($55 US) along with others and that was a great experience. The food was great, but the sav\/blac was a little average, but hey there was a open bar and that more than made up for it. The fast boat to and from the island can be uncomfortable during rough weather so if you are elderly make sure you are in a seat with something to hold onto during the 30 minute trip. The boat pulls up beside the entrance gate into Male airport and within minutes you are inside.\r\nOur Beach Villa room was spacious and comfortable, the outside toilet and shower ensuite was different, but very acceptable. Overall we are both happy that we stayed at Adaaran. My only 'Con' was that the Kayaks do not have padded seats with backs included. Tough to paddle if you have a worn out old back.","text":"Our stay was part of the tour of Sri Lanka which was a fantastic experience. The tour was arranged by TripADeal and it went without an issue.

On arrival everything was as it should be with transfer and welcome meeting, we originally had a garden villa and have to be honest they are not great. They shouldn\u2019t at the price feel like 2nd rate accommodation but unfortunately do, with the metal roofs and tired interiors. So with the help of Vicky we upgraded and paid for a beach villa no 218. This was amazing for my family. At the banyan buffet restaurant we had a large table of 10 as we had joined our friends and our waiter was outstanding, Ibrahim was amazing with the 6 children aged 3-9 always making sure they had drinks and everything they needed. During our stay we had a birthday and wedding anniversary and he decorated the table with flowers and coloured sands. Thankyou so much ibrahim your hard work and professionalism is a credit to the resort and your family. It\u2019s been mentioned many times about the prices of the spa and water sports which are ridiculously expensive, I treated my wife and female friend to a massage. They both said it was amazing. But at $99 each with taxes the cost was $246 for the 2. Maybe this is why the spa is dead and you can always, with no notice get a treatment , not great business sense. A 10 minute jet ski hire was $60 plus taxes. Again another reason why most of our break the 4 jet skis were just sat around unused. Has to be mentioned these two areas are external companies but I feel the resort owners should get this looked at, For me the issue with this resort is,it\u2019s trying to be too many things, it\u2019s for couples and families and, unfortunately during our stay a large group of male surfers. During our 2nd week a DJ turned up with his equipment to entertain these surfers and on the worst evening it disrupted everyone until past midnight, we finally feel asleep at 1am. I have to say the manager, who clearly was inundated with complaints dealt with this the next day. The DJ was around after we left for a further 4 days so not sure what had happened since. This island clearly has an identity problem, it\u2019s a beautiful island with amazing staff and the manager and deputy manager Marcos are working hard to improve all areas, but for me on my 3rd visit to the Maldives I haven\u2019t come away with that Maldives experience. I\u2019ve come away with amazing memories and met amazing people from all over the world ,the staff are amazing, from the guy who swept the leaves outside our villa named momin who fist bumped my children and always had a smile to our amazing waiters or Vicky who goes above and beyond in customer care but with the expansion project to build another 100 lodges and increase in price to incorporate the new \u201cpremium all inclusive\u201d I do wonder if this island will ever deliver the tranquil Maldives experience.\r\nHaving said all this we had a lovely holiday and would like to thank all the wonderful staff who work so hard to make it a lovely experience.","text":"Just returned from a 10 day break at this resort.

Thank you to our room boy- villa 272. The rooms do however require some updating\/modernising. Each villa has x2 of their own sun loungers.\r\nSnorkelling is a must! You can rent an underwater camera from water sports. They were very helpful and friendly. Thank you all! We also went jet skiing. What a fantastic experience! Great fun.\r\nThe dolphin excursion was enjoyable even though unfortunately we didn\u2019t see any that day.\r\nThe spa massage was lovely and staff very professional. Spa reasonably priced.\r\nWeather- we had a mix of sunshine and rain during our stay but after all it is rainy season. It doesn\u2019t rain continuously though! You will still get plenty of sunshine.\r\nWe upgraded our last two nights to the water villa stay, It was heaven. The food was amazing!Some of the best I\u2019ve ever tried. I would say if you are able to do so, do it! The experience is worth it. Everything is different.\r\nThank you to everyone at Adaaran Select- We loved every minute of our stay.

The chefs are very friendly always asking how you are and chatting as you serve yourself. You have the same waiter for the whole of your stay and they are very professional and my drink was at my table when I returned from choosing my food without even asking.\r\nOn my birthday I came back to a beautifully decorated bed and in the evening I had a special table and they brought out a cake even though I hadn't mentioned it was my birthday they made it one to remember.\r\nThe weather is very changeable and the beach does wash up with seaweed etc but it is quickly cleared away. The sea temperature was my biggest surprise don't expect to cool off its so warm!!\r\nIt has been mentioned that the thatch etc is looking shabby in places.

The beer selection was great but If you only consume a small amount of alcohol each day then just purchase as you3 go, there will be more choices but don't forget it can be more expensive if planned to consume more then a 2 or 3 a day. The activities each day were great from start to end, the boat staff were very attendative to making sure you felt safe at all times\r\nThe only thing that is still playing on my mind is the charges for non motorised activity and hiring of snorkeling gear. Most places I've visited offer these as part of the experience at the resort.\r\nAlthough the buildings aren't the best looking, they are clean and tidy. The bed needs to be replaced in the villa we were staying in, each morning was pain full. But once you stepped out on to the deck each morning you would soon forget the bed pain.\r\nEach morning while having my coffee I would see lots of fish gather close by.

We could climb down its wooden steps into the warm waters anytime we wanted to stake a dip in the coral blue sea.\r\nThe villa had a TV with limited channels, a tea service, a free bottle of water which was replenished daily, a mini fridge stocked with soft drinks, and excellent air conditioning. The views of the sunset across the sea were incredible.\r\nWe had to walk from our water villa to the main island for our meals. We took the Breakfast & Dinner package. The food was excellent, with sufficient choice for the vegetarian guests also. Drinks were expensive, but happy hours from 5.30 to 6.30 pm made them affordable. The evening\u2019s highlight was the shark feed. At 7pm each evening, they fed the fish which swam around the bar area. The tranquil sea would turn turbulent with dozens of fish including sting rays and sharks that rushed in to be fed.

He showed us to our villas and later gave us a short trip around the island, to see what it had to offer. Throughout our whole stay, he went above and beyond what we expected and made sure everything was perfect.\r\nWe spent our first two nights in the Ocean Villas where we had easy access to fantastic snorkelling (We even swam with a turtle on our very first day out). The last two nights we moved to one of the Ocean Pavilions which even further blew us away, really an unbelievable experience.\r\nThe food was also all we could have wanted and more, with the breakfast buffet changing certain things every day to make sure it was kept interesting, to the different themes they would have for the dinner, it would be hard to ever be bored of what they had to offer.\r\nThe waiting staff were incredibly helpful with any request or questions we would have and would always welcome us with a smile.\r\nEven the housekeeping staff left us amazed at how they seemingly could clean our rooms without us ever really running into them doing it, even though we were for the most part only out of the rooms while eating.\r\nIt seems impossible to find anything bad to say about our stay in paradise and we\u2019re already looking forward to, hopefully, being able to come back in a few years.\r\nThank you Saain and the rest of the staff, for giving us an

Now there are a thousand and one reviews on TA regarding Kurumba so just believe me when I say all of the good things said are true and not exaggerated and the negative comments are purely personal taste. Yes there is a lot of aircraft noise but that doesn't bother me so don't let it bother you - just go there. Actually, I quite like watching the aircraft go by so there is an example of personal taste for you. Anyway, I am not going to repeat what a thousand other people have said about Kurumba and I am just going to tell you what happened to us during our stay and that will tell you just how good this place is. We stayed during January 2020 and this was our second visit - the first being 2017 and we thought then that this place was total paradise so you can't improve on it and we knew exactly what we were going to receive on our second visit. How wrong we were! After the journey from hell - Dubai airport was temporarily closed the previous evening due to thunder storms of Biblical proportions which flooded the runway so there was a back log - we were greeted on the jetty by a Kurumba representative who shook my hand and said \"Welcome back to Kurumba - please follow me\" A young lady then ushered us into one of the electric carts they have and drove us to our room to check us in - in our room. Great start after many delays left us wondering if we were ever going to get there. As we were also celebrating Alison's birthday Kurumba had left a few little treats in our room - some apricots, dates, nuts and some delicious chocolates. Thank you! On the day of Alison's birthday nothing was said but we had booked an evening meal in Thila and when we arrived they were ready for us with a \"happy birthday\" and please come this way. The table was decorated with beautiful flowers and two complimentary glasses of champagne were swiftly delivered. The meal was followed by a verse of \"happy birthday\" from the waiters and small but adequate cake was presented to Alison. Brilliant - thank you! We then went for a last drink at the Kandu bar and then disaster struck. I had bought Alison a small Pandora bracelet and put four charms on it and while we were sitting in Kandu Alison realised the bracelet had become undone and all four charms were missing. I told her to stay where she was and I went back to Thila to look for them. Anwar - the manager helped me and we found two of them but assumed the other two had slipped down between the boards and into the lagoon below. On our way back to our room we called into reception to thank them for the brilliant birthday celebrations and to say if anyone found a couple of Pandora charms and handed them in we would be eternally grateful. The following day we received a message to say that one more charm had been found by the guys at Thila. Furthermore - to continue the saga - we were having dinner at the Isola restaurant the following evening and a lovely Japanese lady called Miho came and introduced herself. She had been the duty manager the previous evening and had been told of our disaster with the Pandora charms. While we were tucked up in bed, Miho had gone to the Thila restaurant, had a word with Anwar and decided the missing charm was in the lagoon. So what did Miho do - she jumped into the water with a flashlight to look for it ! What can I say...that is way beyond the call of duty. I can not think of any other place in the world where the duty manager will go for a midnight swim trying to locate a missing Pandora charm. Thank you Miho. Over the course of our second visit to Kurumba, we came across Miho quite a few times and let me tell you that she is so enthusiastic about making people happy you will only have to meet her once and you will never forget her. Miho is like a bottle of champagne - when the cork comes out everything around you begins to fizz with lots of excited bubbles! Oh hang on - I forgot to mention that on the day of Alison's birthday - after another hard day on the sunbed - we returned to our room to find the bed decorated with flower petals. That evening - after the disaster with the Pandora charms - we returned to our room to find the flower petals had been replaced with a multitude of flowers and the message \"Happy birthday Alison\" written with green vines. For that we have to thank Ravi who was our house keeper and an absolute delight whenever we saw him. Here is another subtle change at Kurumba that we can only smile about. There is a wine tasting event held in the lagoon at Athiri One which has now turned into a welcome meeting for new guests and what a brilliant event it is. Please go to it and have a drink served by the happiest bar tenders I have ever come across and more importantly - meet the team who are there to make you smile. All of the managers are there - activity, spa, promotion, divers etc. Also the two men we never saw on our last visit - these two guys are new I hasten to add - the general manager Andrew and the executive chef Janne. Mady the M.C. for the event encouraged us to seek them out if ever we want anything. These subtle changes have improved Kurumba beyond measure. All of the management team are highly visible - especially Janne the executive chef because he is constantly moving between restaurants - all day long - and he will come to you to ask if everything is fine. I don't think he ever walked passed us without stopping and so by the end of our holiday we were damn near on first name terms and I have got his personal card should I wish to call him before our next visit. This place just keeps getting better! So one morning as we stepped out of the Vihamanaa restaurant after breakfast there was Janne on his way in. \"So how was your breakfast - was everything OK?\" Yes Janne - it always is. Anyway, Alison really likes oysters but Thila doesn't do them tempura style which is how she really likes them. So Janne - while we've got your attention - have you ever thought of doing tempura style oysters because Alison really likes tempura style oysters. We got the standard Kurumba answer to all inquiries which is - well of course, you shall have them tonight. The chefs at Thila are very good but I rather think they had never done a tempura oyster before because as we sat down and ordered our meal Janne appeared and went into the kitchen. The kitchen has a glass wall and you can watch all that is going on. At the end of our meal Janne appeared just to check - how were the oysters? Just like Kurumba Janne - absolutely brilliant ! Andrew the general manager will not walk passed you without exchanging a few words but on the occasions when it does happen it is because he is already speaking to somebody else. The moral of the story is - if you want to see the general manager or the duty manager just ask. If there is a dish you like but can't find at any of the superb restaurants at Kurumba - ask to see Janne and if he has the raw ingredients he will personally make it for you. This place is heaven - so get used to it ! We spent the rest of our time there basically having fun with all of the boys and girls that work there. Because a place like Kurumba needs diversity about half of the permanent staff are from all around the world so I don't know how many languages are available at Kurumba but it's a lot. Janne the executive chef is from Finland - Andrew the general manager is half Swede half Thai (that's a powerful cocktail) and Miho is Japanese. We began by learning their names (they wear name badges so it is easy) and then we started asking them where they were from and how do you say thank you in your language. Their primary function is to make you smile - make you happy - so we wanted to make them smile and smile they do when you say thank you in their native language. Honestly, we had so much fun learning \"thank you\" in Nepali, Indonesian, Thai, Maldivian, Sri Lankan, Japanese, Arabic, Filipino, Bangladeshi etc. They make you smile so make them smile and smile they will if you just learn one word - thank you ! So a thousand thanks go to Andrew, Janne, Miho, Sasha, Farrah, Noor, Fardoush, Hillary, Bandera, Jessica, Anwar, Panicha, Ahmed, Nur, Allina, Jamil, Khan and Ravi. All of those aforementioned beautiful people made our stay at Kurumba total heaven but I would just like to give a big shout out for Ravi for his artistic decorations on our bed and for keeping our room in the best condition, for Panicha who couldn't stop smiling at our attempts to speak Thai and to Sasha for mixing brilliant cocktails - for brilliant service and for great conversations. I know eventually - when time allows - Kurumba will read this review so we would just like to say thank you for a brilliant holiday and with no word of a lie we are already making enquiries for a return visit in 2021. See you then !\r\n","text":"We have just returned from a ten day visit to Kurumba during which I kept saying to my partner Alison - why didn't you book it for three weeks?

The main two reasons we did was due to the location close to Male (after a flight into Abu Dhabi and then another to Male, we were more than happy with the short speed boat to Kurumba) and the choice of restaurants whey opportunity to do all inclusive.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we arrived into Male, the excellent service started, our luggage was taken from us onto the boat, we were given water and cold towels. We didn\u2019t see our bags again until they were delivered to our room - perfect! On check in we were given a delicious coconut sorbet and the whole check in process was so relaxing!\r\n\r\nOur room was fabulous, exceptionally clean, such a good size, great beach view and the bathroom - wow!! I had been worried about bugs in the outside bathroom but there was no need I didn\u2019t see any our whole stay!\r\n\r\nWe did a walk around the island most days which was lovely, very easy to walk around on the paths or beach! Again everywhere was exceptionally clean and well looked after!\r\n\r\nNow the food, we went all inclusive dine around as we like to have a choice of where to eat at dinner, and so glad we did! We have been to many all inclusives throughout the world but the restaurants and food at Kurumba was out of this world! We dined at Indian, Thai, Lebanese, Teppanyaki & Seafood and all were amazing! We kept the seafood one until last and so glad we did, it was a lovely romantic last night with the tables by the water looking into the ocean. At lunchtime we tended to eat in the restaurant (rather than the buffet) and it was great, such a good menu selection! I am gluten free (although not coeliac) and the options there were great, they fully understood my issue and never made it a problem - I believe their head chef is also gluten intolerant.\r\n\r\nWe used the beach bar for sunset drinks and had great service there, as we did at the main bar in the evening! All of the staff we met were fantastic, bar staff in the evening even came to knew mine and my husbands usual drinks. We also met quite a lot of the management team who greeted us by name and always asked was there any more they could do, and I felt they genuinely meant it! Although there never was as everything was perfect!!\r\n\r\nAll staff were great and we didn\u2019t manage to get everyone\u2019s names but April at the bar was always so helpful, really quick service and always very friendly! Then Brian served us at a couple of the restaurants including the teppanyaki and he was fantastic, nothing was too much for him and again super friendly!\r\n\r\nI would 100% recommend anyone to visit, couples, groups of friends, families with children!

It's a old gem in South Ari atoll of Maldives 25mins by seaplane gorgeous ride from Velena seaplane terminal. They have their own branded waiting lounge for the guests if there has to be a waiting time which is tastefully done with quick bites freshly made on daily basis replenished as per the meal timings throughout the day. I must say the service and food are the aspects I look into when it comes hospitality. Conrad has the matured staff with their long services to this resort as well as international standards of food and beverage spread and deliverance. Their excellent staff SHINE who is their F&B Sales Manager handle our requests before even we had packed our bags and during the stay she was bang on prompt on whatever our needs and preferences were. She has a great future in this industry for sure.\r\n\r\nI would fall short explaining what is Conrad experience, in the Maldives but would request if you planning Maldives just book this resort and contact Shine for your F&B preferences and recommendations from her end. She would just handle it with a beautiful smile and ease.\r\n\r\nLove you Conrad Maldives hope to see you soon. Again I would say what makes you the legend or makes u stand aside from the so called rat race of COMPSETS as they call it is your immaculate presentation and attention to details in your f&b and your service is world class.

We spend our holiday at Angsana Velavaru from the 10th of November zu the 21st of November 2019. To sum it all up: we had an unforgettable Holiday. Special thanks right at the beginning to the exceptional staff at this Resort. We spend one night in a Deluxe Beachfront Pool Villa and 10 nights in the Inocean Pool Villa with Sala facing towards the sunset. The people who made our stay so special were Mamdhooh (Azurro Restaurant), Ali (Room keeper), Ageel and Ahmet Javad from the Dive Center and Nitu (Marine Lab). Thank you all for taking that good care of us and becoming good Friends! We will miss you!\r\n\r\nLets start with the infrastructure. All villas are beautifully designed and got a special charm. As we spend most of the time at the Inocean Villas, we figured out the biggest advantage to be the direct access to the house reef. The island and the in ocean side are not connected. Therefore, a boat acts as a shuttle each hour. That may seem restrictive but it didnt feel like an issue at all. On our stay we did not do any Spa treatment or watersportsactivities. We focused on snorkling, diving and doing some excursions. Everything seems very clean and well maintained. We stayed in Villa 341 which faces towards the sunset and gives an remarkable few in the afternoon. Also, you may say Groups of dolphines Swimming along the house reef. The Equipment and the Villa itself is absolutly stunning.\r\n\r\nFood: Both the island and the Inocean side got their own restauraunts. We ate on both sides and loved it. On the island you got a beautiful view through the palms while having a more conventional a la carte menu. On the other side the a la carte is a slightly bit more luxury. In ocean you got a Buffet each morning and every second day for dinner. As we had Half Board, we did not try the lunch menu. What was really special for us was the service we received from Mamdhooh and the kitchen. Very kind und helpful and always trying to make your stay better - that very succesfully!\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nA said diving and snorkling were our main activities closely followed by watching the stingray feeding and playing beach volleyball with the staff. Sting Ray feeding takes part each day at 5 pm. It is very informative and by the end we knew and identified each stingray with theri names. Thanks to Nitu and the Marine Lab at this point.\r\nAs the housereef is positioned a bit outside the island, you can only access the reef directly from the In Ocean Side. Nevertheless the Resort does a free of charge snorkling trip each day at 11 am which brings you to certain snorkling spots around the island. Diving with Ahmed Javad was excpetional all the way. We had a great time diving around the different spots and saw tons of fish, very nice corals and reefs together with big fish like Grey Reef Sharks, Turtles and big groups of Eagle Rays. To see something more special we went for the Whaleshark snorkling Trip with Ageel. Honestly a great trip. We were lucky seeing Dolphins, Manta Rays and a Whaleshark all on one trip. We can highly recommend to do night fishing aswell. On that trip you go out to fishing on a traditional wayto catch your own fishes which will be served for lunch the day after and you can order in 3 different styles.\r\n\r\nReef: Another thanks to the Marine Lab. They do their best to recreate and save the reefs as it was also efffected by coral bleaching in 2016. Close to the villas the reef isnt very nice but hat some fish though. But still in direct access from the inocean villas once you follow the border of the housereef you can see a beautiful housereef which is well recovering and healing together with a really big amount of fish! You may also see turtles, rays and small sharks there. Honstly this reef was way better than I would have expected it to be. While diving you can even get to points, there some parts look the way they did many many years ago.\r\n\r\nAgain to sum it all up: - WE WILL COME BACK ","text":"Hello everybody.

Everybody at the island gave 100% and we had hard working staff to look after us. Yes we had some rain during the stay but that all cleared within a couple of hours and the sun was shining again. This was the first island we've been to that we did not have buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner but a nicely done set menu and to be honest it worked very well with not stuffing ourselves. The food was great, maybe some more local fish on the menu but that is just a small suggestion. Big thank you to - Svetlana at reception, Fannie, Karen, Hatheem in Azzuro restaurant and Alex at the bar, also thank you to Robin from The Netherlands for making our morning coffee. Our room boy cleaned the villa twice a day and always put so much effort of making the place spotlessly clean, thank you Adam! Also it was great to meet Mr Nicola Spehar, lovely Croatian chap who is part of the management.\r\nBut above all thank you to General Manager Mr Mourad Essafi for spending some time with us and taking on board our suggestions, he is a very professional and knowledgeable manager who will resolve any issues straight away.\r\nTo conclude: beach villas are mostly done and they look amazing! If they need they will offer you the best accommodation to enjoy your holiday and to relax.\r\nI would highly recomend this beautiful island and maybe one day we will be back.","text":"We visited from 4\/11-14\/11 and had an amazing time at this beautiful resort.\r\nOriginaly we booked a beach villa on the island but due to extended refurbishments we had been upgarded to ocean villas away from the island, so thank you to the management for that gesture.\r\nOur villa was amazing, 2 floors with huge space and infinity pool at the...","nickname":"Beautiful island - relaxing holiday"},{"title":"Amazing adventure","date":"20191101","rating":"5","full_text":"Just back from a week's stay in mid-November. First visit to The Maldives so others may be better placed to make comparisons but our overall opinion was that it was an amazing place to visit. We booked last minute and as many do, we were able to secure an attractive price given the ongoing refurbishments.\r\n\r\nWhether you notice the work depends perhaps on your expectations. The plus side is that on a few days it felt like we were the only visitors - thus it matched our expectations of visiting a desert(ed) island. On the downside, island dwellers like us did feel a little bit second class compared to the lagoon villa's, where the restaurant for example, was in full swing. Half way through our stay we were allowed to eat (as part of the AI package) at the 'villa's Azzurro restaurant and this I felt was an example of the hotel evolving and re-establishing itself after a hiatus.\r\n\r\nLocation is stunning. White sandy beaches, turquoise waters, amazing sunsets and teaming with wildlife. Staff were amazing. Some are young and in-experienced but the hotel has recruited well for the future. As an aside, we would have liked to have left a tip at reception for all staff but this isn't currently catered for. A little positive was the helpful gentleman at Male airport who guides you between the two terminals.\r\n\r\nPlenty to do - we barely got through a book. Loved the daily snorkelling trip and got to swim with sharks, turtles, eagle rays and plenty of fish. You can watch the sharks and sting rays from the beach and saw an octopus (whilst snorkelling) only 2 metres from the shore line. Don't miss the love birds and the fruit bats. A stroll round the island takes 30 mins and a canoe trip likewise. Alternatively, you can just sit back and do nothing...\r\n\r\nWe stayed in one of the refurbished infinity pool villas. We liked the 'zen' enclosed garden with outside shower - a treat under the moonlight. Food was generally good and occasionally very good. I think this will be a minor issue until full occupancy returns, though this may be some time. One mistake we did make was to pack lots of shoes! This is definitely a flip flop and barefoot place.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an amazing location with amazing staff. Yes, there are a few niggles but there is unlikely to be a better time to visit on reasonably attractive terms.","text":"Just back from a week's stay in mid-November.

Over our 6 night stay we stayed in both the beach and water villa on half board basis. The beach villa was a good size with clean and upto date facilities, but was basic for the money paid, the water villa was another league the well designed villa had incredible interior backed up with incredible views! Personally we felt the beach villa was not worth the money and other resorts offer slightly more exclusive areas for the same price where as the water villa was worth every penny, we would return but would complete our whole trip in the water villa. There was plenty going on through the hotel, throughout our stay we had massages at the spa which were fairly priced and incredible as well as a candle lit dinner on the beach, also incredible! The staff are amazing and were always available, they work off a WhatsApp basis too, our representative on site was Rita, she was very efficient, friendly and booked and planned both our spa trip and dinner, this was a nice Touch! The hotel was very kind and we were giffed a few upgrades always a bonus! The facilities at the hotel were always clean and well attended and there was plenty of choice in activities and food. As anywhere in the Maldives extras were expensive one night of room service composing of two burgers, and one desert was $80, this is expected of the Maldives but is something to be aware of. Also service charge and tax, do watch this menus and excursions did not include either, our end bill had over $150 in service charges so do feel free to ask and clarify.\r\nAmazing hotel, amazing experience.","text":"We stayed at the paradise resort after 10 days in Sri Lanka, the resort from\r\nThe get go was clean well furnished and the scenic environment you pair with the Maldives.

We have never come across this level of service previously It is 5 star.\r\nBeach is fantastic although I would if you have a choice book on the east of the island where the snorkelling and beach are both fantastic.

The quality of the food I can only describe as outstanding as I in particular enjoy Indian cuisine. Western foods are also prepared to a high standard which my wife prefers but it\u2019s not \u2018buffet style\u2019 like many other hotels it\u2019s prepared specifically for you and table served by the excellent team of waiters.

The first part of our trip was the boat ride to get to the place. It was 40 minutes long filled with the amazing view of the Maldives and its various islands. However, it must be warned that when we had come the sea was very choppy and it is not advised for people who get seasick. When we reached the hotel we were met by four different people who gave us a hot towel and a peach iced tea. We were then shown around the island and to our rooms as well. The island itself is very interactive with its guests. At 4 pm they serve a selection of iced teas and guests can feed the sea animals that are along the shore of the island. Some of the animals include Needlefish, Stingrays and Herons. Surprisingly the hotel also had a pool as well as a jacuzzi, and a bar area with a gigantic seating room and a TV. The hotel also had a ping pong table, a snorkeling center, a spa, and football courts. Lastly, the hotel also had excursions and trips that you could pay for as well, which we didn't need to go too because our day was full doing everything else! A strong recommendation of mine is to get a water villa. This is because it is so convenient as you have the sea right in front of you when you step outside. The rooms itself is massive and is an amazing sight to wake up to in the mornings. You can also snorkel near your villa and see many schools of fish. Another great thing about this place was the food. Every day the menus for breakfast and dinner were different so there was a variety of selection for food. A few recommendations of mine for breakfast would be the vegetable omelet, pancake, Belgian waffle, and the fresh juices. For lunch and dinner, it is obvious their Indian options were very good but their pasta and salads are also very tasty. A slight criticism of this place in most reviews would be the price, but if someone is able to go to the Maldives this place is highly recommended and worth its price. However, owning an Indian passport, we did not have to pay for breakfast or dinner as it was included in the initial price. You must take advantage of their complementary activities and their packages as it can save you a lot of money in the long run. Make sure to see all the daily activities given by the cleaners of the rooms. Hopefully you will love this place as much as we did!","text":"We had come to this place in a family of four and this was one of our best trips yet!

The Villas are a good size and comfortable with lovely outdoor 'natural' bathrooms.\r\nThe staff were exemplary - some of the best I've come across. We were lucky enough to have Sam as our waiter who's so friendly and couldn't have been better. Thank you, Sam. Other staff members to mention were Farood - a complete legend, Waheed was extremely helpful and our room boy. The staff at Angsana really, really make the stay as great as it is.\r\nThe food is brilliant - highly recommend at least half board. Dinner is an absolute treat and they strike a great balance offering alternate nights of a la carte and buffet.\r\nGood amenities. You are provided with a snorkel and mask and can have free SUP and kayak - both are great fun. There is table tennis and board games - not to mention the free speedboat crossing to the sister island, Banyan Tree. The gym is absolutely fine and more than I expected when choosing my stay.\r\nThe reef is incredible! Cannot recommend it enough. We saw so many sharks, stingrays and turtles. The highlight was swimming over the top of the 3m nurse shark!\r\nAll in all, Agnsana made our honeymoon extremely memorable and we can't wait to visit again!","text":"Stayed five nights for honeymoon.

We opted for the speed boat transfer (provided by the resort for a fee) to take us from and to the airport, and I would recommend this option to those who plan to stay at this hotel. The resort is part of the Accor consortium and the sister island where the Banyan Tree resort is located (about 1 minute away by the speed boat) offers an opportunity for change of ambiance, restaurants, and views. The boat service between the islands is present typically every hour or so with some exceptions. There is a routine sting ray feeding session in the early evening on a daily basis. We also opted for the Angsana Ihuru resort because there is a 5 star PADI Scuba Dive center right on the island, thus there is no need to take a boat to another location. The staff at this dive center were extremely helpful in planning out our dives. The reef surrounding the island was adequate to blow away many other locations in terms of variety of marine life to be seen. We had many uneventful encounters with blacktip sharks during the time when we were snorkeling around the island (which typically takes about an hour). The spa facility was tranquil and the spa staff were extremely gracious. They treated us like royalty.

This was our first time in the Maldives and a special holiday to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary and our daughter's imminent 18th birthday. Everything was perfect from the moment we were greeted at Male airport until our departure. One of the main reasons we chose Angsana Ihuru was for the house reef, it certainly did not disappoint. It felt like we were snorkelling in the tropical tank in our local aquarium so many different species of fish. Yes, there are areas where the coral is dead\/bleached and this is the same throughout the Maldives. However the island is undertaking significant restorative work on the coral reef and that is very evident and a joy to see. During our stay we saw dolphins on a couple of occasions just off the house reef and saw at least one of the turtles (there are apparently three) on a couple of occasions when snorkelling.\r\n\r\nWe cannot praise the wonderful staff highly enough. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly throughout our stay, with nothing being too much trouble. Particular thanks must go to Mooso (the gentleman who looked after our villa with such wonderful friendliness and care), Shareef (who looked after us each mealtime which such gentle attention, enthusiasm and kindness) and Faheed in the restaurant and Ogy in the bar (sharing his cocktail recommendations, magic tricks and teaching us how to play Mancala). The staff were particularly caring when our daughter was not feeling well for a couple of days during the stay. The villas are set around the edge of the island and each set back slightly and have their own little oasis of seclusion, with round daybed, swingseat and beach recliners on the waters edge. The pictures on the villas on the company website are a true reflection and our jet pool villa (number 4) was fantastic. The food is simply excellent with such a huge choice there is definitely something for everyone. During our stay my daughter and I visited the spa for a massage and we absolutely loved it. My husband and daughter also made use of the Kayaks and SUPs which you can use (without charge). If you stay make sure you visit the sister island Banyan to see the stingrays being fed - an amazing sight. We could go on and on waxing lyrical about this island. We do hope to visit again in the future.","text":"We have just returned from two weeks on this wonderful island with its equally wonderful staff.
